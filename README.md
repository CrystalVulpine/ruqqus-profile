## [GitHub pages site](https://crystalvulpine.github.io/ruqqus-profile/)

This is an archive site meant to bring back all my ruqqus posts since the site shut down. It uses nunjucks to render ruqqus's jinja2 templates with static json data plugged in.

Some data might be missing or corrupted, and much of the usual functionality of ruqqus is broken or bugged. 30 of my posts were skipped by the API and had to be copied out of the comment data or an HTML crawl; 29 of these were placed at the end of my posts, the most recent one was moved to the beginning. Many other posts and comments are also out of order. I may sort everything by timestamp at some point.

You can click on any of my posts or comments to browse the rest of that post as well.

To-do:

* Fix creation and edit dates not showing (need a function to convert the timestamps)

* Add dark mode

* Make the JS functions work more often

* Reconstruct some posts that got auto-removed in the purge

* Fix tooltips not showing
