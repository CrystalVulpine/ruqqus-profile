Here are the python scripts I used to export my posts and comments from the available data. To use them yourself, you'll have to figure it out since they're a mess and I'm too lazy to change them (I *think* you want to go export.sh, comparepostlists.py and add the extra ones to myposts.json, comparepostlists_html.py and do the same thing, then getcommentedonposts.py, then get that one's ids and put it in the list of processed posts in getedgeposts.py and run it). Use these at your own risk. Also, you'll have to download and extract the ruqqus database files:
