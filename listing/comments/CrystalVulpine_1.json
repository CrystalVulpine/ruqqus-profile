Do you think they're going to run reddit as ghosts or something?</p>\n<p>Just admit that all you care about is getting your revenge. And since you're going to have that attitude then don't complain when other people demand retribution from you. Reddit colluding with the FBI (if your story is true) to threaten you is outlandishly evil, but you are proposing even worse things for them. Don't hold other people to a different standard than yourself, especially one so draconian. What reddit is doing is wrong but that doesn't excuse you to do the same things. Two wrongs don't make a right. You would probably love to become a ruthless dictator who shall not be questioned. You are clearly a radical authoritarian yourself, just like the reddit power user cabal aka DefaultMods.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1590812070, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_lmn", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#ff4500", "created_utc": 1580069029, "description": "Documenting the fall of Reddit.", "description_html": "<p>Documenting the fall of Reddit.</p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_1c", "id": "1c", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "WatchRedditDie", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/watchredditdie/profile-5.png"}, "guild_id": "1c", "herald_guild": null, "id": "lmn", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent": {"author_name": "Troll", "award_count": 0, "body": "Suffering is important because it helps certain people realize their true potential and understand ethical behavior if they are incapable of reason.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason something called \"punishment\" exists and that is to deter and avenge wrongs committed in our society.
