It's clear they collude together and it's all for deep state profit.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice how most of our \"political\" controversies are petty arguments over religion, college campuses, lgbt, television shows, social media, BLM, etc. that have absolutely nothing to do with politics. Yet the division works, and we find people strongly taking one side or the other...as both sides pass the exact same things! All the actual political arguments, like the economy, checks and balances, rights, etc. are either secondary or completely off the table. Think about it, there's a ton of things no one ever questions and if you do you're *immediately* dismissed as a lunatic:\r\n\r\n* The federal government is the main decision maker in every aspect of life\r\n\r\n* Very exhaustive k-12 academic indoctrination is a requirement\r\n\r\n* Insanely restrictive ip laws prohibit even internet memes as a huge felony (more the fault of international organizations than the US)\r\n\r\n* The federal government is very strong and can literally do whatever it wants as long as all the politicians agree\r\n\r\n* We blindly listen to the elites and go through the system of school, college, 9-5 job, die\r\n\r\n* Rights are considered outdated and \"collective\" interests are generally viewed as more important\r\n\r\n* The government is the true owner of all your property and even your life, as it can dictate it and you even rent your land and income from them (taxes).\r\n\r\n* The majority always rules and everyone must conform\r\n\r\n* Everyone must vote Democrat or Republican, and if you don't vote the same as someone else you're their enemy\r\n\r\n* Anyone who questions the system is just an whining idiot extremist who should not be listened to\r\n\r\nThere are plenty more things, but the point is all the actual political stuff is completely unanimous: full government totalitarian control to profit the deep state. All this show of the Republicans and Democrats supposedly hating each other is just a distraction. Wake up people, your candidates' \"positions\" are nothing more than their personal opinions. All the politicians vote for the exact same things.
