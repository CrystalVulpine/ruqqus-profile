Jesus said you're either with me or against me. We've tried the experiment of letting everyone play in our sandbox, and it doesn't work. We need to establish our own true Christian nation to stand alone, free from obfuscation and subversion.\r\n\r\nSome jews used this argument to try and stop gentiles from being reached. They were prejudiced and *wanted* the gentiles to be lost. Similarly Jonah didn't want to minister to a race he didn't like, and he was swallowed by a whale and spit out on the shore of that country. You are showing the same contempt for certain peoples *you* don't like and want to keep them away. You are not only allowed, but *commanded* to shine light in the world. Secluding yourself and hating outsiders like the Amish do just shows a \"stay away from us we're better than you you're not good enough to be around us\" kind of pride. And pride is who's attitude?\r\n\r\n> Read this a few times, and I'm not understanding what you mean. Can you clarify?\r\n\r\nClassical literature and plays are often quoted. Most famously is Paul alluding to seeing through a glass darkly which is actually from Plato (though some dispute whether Paul wrote that passage). They referenced popular entertainment and literature to convey their ideas just as we do today.\r\n\r\n> People have worshipped sports for too long. Evil in power has recognized and used that against us as a pacifier and distraction from what's important(life, family, church, etc.). It's evident in how rich these organizations have gotten. It's not even about the game anymore; it's all money, fame, power, idolization. Pure evil.\r\n\r\nI don't get the obsession with watching a couple guys throw a ball around either. But if your argument is that the sports corporations are too rich, then you shouldn't do almost anything by that logic. Not even buy essentials, because most of them are made by rich companies. You might as well go completely off the grid.\r\n\r\n> There's a reason big games are on Sundays, and I've always suspected it - pulling us from God.

For example most Europeans know 3+ languages and can speak all of them perfectly fluently, completely comfortably, whereas Americans can only speak English, and even if they learn another language they struggle to comfortably hold a conversation in it. They often can debate, do math, draw, play music, program, etc. very well more than the average American.
