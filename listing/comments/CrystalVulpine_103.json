Of course they exist, that's a fact.\r\n\r\n> Even Paul spoke separately about how men and women should act.\r\n\r\nNo he didn't and I don't care how much \"the church\" spews propaganda that he was a crusader for Greco-Roman traditions. When you can't beat em, join em, and infiltrate them from the inside. And that's exactly what both the Romans and the unbelieving Jewish sects did. Paul was the exact opposite and that's one reason they hated him and other Christians so bad. For Paul, the world in its present form is passing away and such wordly systems are not profitable. Not that Paul is on equal authority to Jesus regardless, let alone *more* important like people seem to think.\r\n\r\n> If you don't know what it is, then why do you so passionately disagree with this SBC document about it? My takeaway from it is that SBC also thinks it shouldn't be much of a thought.\r\n\r\nBecause the SBC didn't bring up the SJW attitude and hypocrisy and censorship and tantrums; it's not condemning that (I am not saying that the SBC does not condemn that, I mean this article in particular doesn't bring it up). It argued against the idea that there should be no discrimination (and note that discrimination can be equal).

This is not entirely against the ToS - however, some of their practices during the event may be of note.\r\n\r\nI will begin from the aftermath of my previous post and continue in the chronological order of the events which took place.\r\n\r\n**The Immediate Aftermath**\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792420867475767316/792422049113047090/lol1_2.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, many users including the admin kek did not take my presence very seriously and began to joke about it. They believe I am harmless - in fact, they believe I am only helping to further help their agenda by creating paranoia for them.\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792420867475767316/792422115475324948/lol2_2.png)\r\n\r\nShortly after they joked around for a while, the server was deleted. This was primarily due to a separate factor and unrelated to my post. However, they soon set up a new server, RCP v2, which is now their base of operations and was used to orchestrate the mass siege. All of the following screenshots are from this server.\r\n\r\n**A Period of Relative Inactivity**\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791699824201695255/792422834999263252/RCP9_2.png)\r\n\r\nThey briefly abstained from using @everyone for brigading after I posted. This may or may not be related to my presence, I would assume the latter but am unsure.\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791699824201695255/792422866586173461/RCP10_2.png)\r\n\r\nImpersonation through the same method they use for guilds - changing the l to a capital i.
