I first noticed this user for having much in common with me, being curious about discovering random things about sites like reddit and ruqqus. Stuff like weird bugs, exploits, tricks, etc. The thing was, she would find more in a day that I ever could in the whole time I've been on the internet (3 years). Stuff about glitches, the API, etc. that I could never even dream of. This person not only was an expert at sniffing out potential vulnerabilities, but could also find bugs by just *casually* reading through code, and stuff that no one else would ever think enough to spot. The infamous infinite coin exploit on ruqqus was found by this user, along with nearly every single interesting bug on the site. She also could recover descriptions of banned subreddits and even link to subreddits that had their names changed to something invalid, using API tricks that literally no one else knows about. On top of that, cqtz has tons of subreddits for CSS and they are ungodly long and written in under a month by casually working on them periodically. /r/srname and /r/RuqqusStyle. On top of that, the tricks used are insane, to the point of combining \\*\\* italics to create elements that can then be used with an invisible link to create color coded text, and other formatting. I am a programmer for many years but have not ever thought of stuff like that, let alone all the time. She can also expertly navigate browser dev consoles and send requests in a browser with just the dev tools, which a google search says you need an extension to do, and also track down every single js event listener and execute js live in the console (something I and most people don't know about because it looks like an error log and doesn't say you can do that).\r\n\r\nI know you're going to tell me \"well she just has more experience than you\". And you'd be wrong. She is *not even a programmer at all*. Intrigued by bugs and stuff yes, but not a programmer. And that's not the only thing. She uses fricking powerpoint to make utterly *faultless* art. I am not joking. Animated gifs too. And it's done in short periods of time while working on all that other stuff at the same time! [Here is one example](https://pic8.co/sh/AXtoip.png) (Note that this was only one of two drawings made in 3 days at the same time, all the while doing everything else too). Perfect coloring, perfect shapes, perfect alignment, perfect 3d perspective, perfect shading, perfect motion capturing, perfect everything. It's out of this world. And yes, I've practiced this for years too, and it's still messy shapes, misaligned, not proportional, \"close enough\" perspective, wrong colors, and either bad or no shading.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, this same person is a savant at documenting events on websites. I, the founder of /r/The_Cabal, should be extremely good at that. But nope. When looking for carpathianflorists replies to me telling me to kill myself, I only found two using the help of my inbox and Ctrl+F. However sfrohne later looked and easily found all 5-6 without the help of my inbox. She's always one of the first to comment on a huge thread, one of the most vocal people, and seems to know exactly where to find every single thread on every site, even the ones no one else has ever seen. Check +SomeGuild and /r/srname for some examples.\r\n\r\nThere's tons of other stuff too. She's humorous, creative, and has a knack for starting major events on websites. She doesn't post a lot but her posts are great. Pretty much every aspect is gifted, and even when I have way more practice I don't even come *close* to her ability in even one thing. There are others like this too, but this is the most extreme example I've personally encountered and can verify. This is not someone cheating with a crafted image either, this is a nerd just trying to have fun and do hobbies. I can tell when people are making a fake persona that's better than they really are, and this is not it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I'm simply not good enough to accomplish things on my own for fun, despite my experience.

Nothing is equal or fair, some people are golden and others aren't. Science has proven that the majority of these things are determined by genes, and a little bit by environmental factors you can't control. That leaves little room for you to have any say in the matter. Trying to succeed at something you don't have the talent for is just as impossible as becoming the opposite sex. People have fundamental differences fixed at birth that almost determine their abilities as well as every aspect about them, and those cannot be changed. And it's all just luck. And no, they're not \"unique but equal\", they really are better or worse than others.</p>\n", "comment_count": 31, "created_utc": 1610310514, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 6, "edited_utc": 1610312950, "fullname": "t2_6jma", "guild_id": "35", "guild_name": "UnpopularOpinion", "herald_guild": null, "id": "6jma", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/6jma/no-amount-of-hard-work-or", "score": 10, "thumb_url": null, "title": "No amount of hard work or passion can make up for a lack of talent", "upvotes": 15, "url": ""}, "post_id": "6jma", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
