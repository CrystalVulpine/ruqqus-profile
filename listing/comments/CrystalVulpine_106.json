In fact, if what you said was true then the verses that indicate God has set authorities over the nations would make God a liar.

No, I don't think so. God raised up Egypt. Egypt chose their leaders in the manner they use. Eventually a pharaoh got nervous bout the Jews and decided to place them under slavery. The Jews cried out and God chose Moses to be his hand and free the people. He hardened the heart of pharaoh so that the Jews, and Egypt, could witness the power of God.\n\nDid God set up Hitler or Stalin? No. God established the creation of Germany and Russia, but men have free will to do as they please and choose their leaders as they please. Men have free will to do evil and subjugate others. Men also have free will to fight against tyranny and oppression. Many people think God has every action of every person mapped out and that we cannot go off script, but this is antithetical to God's love for mankind, which is free will.

I quite enjoy the discussion.", "body_html": "<p>I say it only applies to the Jews because it is literally an account of the Jews asking for a king and God telling Samuel that it was not his plan for them to have a mortal king.  It cannot be applied to all christians because it is LITERALLY spoken from God to the Jews and nowhere does it condemn other nations from having kings. In fact, if what you said was true then the verses that indicate God has set authorities over the nations would make God a liar. God, and Jesus, tell us that while we are on this earth we are subject to the laws and authorities here so long as they do not violate the laws of God. The Jews lived in Egypt under the pharaoh without issue until pharaoh began to crush them under the weight of slavery, after which God sent someone to free them, both to fulfill the prophecy of taking them to the promised land but also because he would not let his people live under oppression. GOD sent someone to instigate the rebellion of the people to escape slavery.</p>\n<p>And when we speak of authorities of nations I don't think we can speak of specific people IN MOST CASES. God is the creator of the nations, but man has free will to choose those to whom they hand the mantle of leadership to, though God may appoint certain people for a purpose. Did God raise up pharaoh? No, I don't think so. God raised up Egypt. Egypt chose their leaders in the manner they use. Eventually a pharaoh got nervous bout the Jews and decided to place them under slavery. The Jews cried out and God chose Moses to be his hand and free the people. He hardened the heart of pharaoh so that the Jews, and Egypt, could witness the power of God.</p>\n<p>Did God set up Hitler or Stalin? No. God established the creation of Germany and Russia, but men have free will to do as they please and choose their leaders as they please. Men have free will to do evil and subjugate others. Men also have free will to fight against tyranny and oppression. Many people think God has every action of every person mapped out and that we cannot go off script, but this is antithetical to God's love for mankind, which is free will.
