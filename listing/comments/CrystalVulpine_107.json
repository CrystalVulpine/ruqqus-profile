A lot of people tend to knee-jerk denounce something if it's uncomfortable for them.

Do you deny the existence of people with retardation disorders? Can you seriously expect an ant to become as smart as a person by sheer will? No you can't. Nurture helps but it still depends on nature. It makes perfect sense biologically, everyone serves a different task in a tribe or society and is optimized for that role. The problem is, this is outdated now. Less than 200 years ago, you carried on your family legacy because that's what you were good at, whether you liked it or not. Some families farmed, because that's what they were good at. Some families entered trades they were good at. Others ran business or became politicians and lawyers, because they were good at that. Men did physical labor and fighting, or less often leading, because that's what they were good at. Women did intellectual and creative things, and raised children, because that's what they were good at. People are social animals, and you are optimized to serve your tribe above all else. So each person is specialized for certain tasks, and other functions are nerfed because they get in the way of the role they're suppose to do. They are also hierarchical by nature, so some will naturally be at the top and capable of more things, while the commoners are more limited and simple. Now we have more time to ourselves to explore passions, but our brains are still hardwired by survival instincts to say \"no\" and prep us for a specialized function to benefit the tribe.

I am a young male whose family has a history of being simple people, mostly farmers and stereotypical workers. And that's fine. But I inherited the optimization for that, and go figure, I am into creating things, programming, storytelling, being funny, drawing, learning, inventing, innovating, imagining things, etc. Of course I struggle to even get acceptable results because my brain is locked in on my biological specialty. Meanwhile others easily do 100x as much as me, and at a level that seems almost faultless from my point of view. They are optimized for those tasks, but I am not, so my ability to do them is blocked so not to get in the way of what I'm biologically primed to do, while theirs is continually strengthened.

Genes even determine up to 80% of how happy you are. Which also makes sense, because some tasks (ie fighting) are better when a person is angry or unhappy. Others are best when the person is happy. As a social animal, your genes don't give a flying fuck about you, they only care about the tribe, and you only matter as far as you will benefit it. It's literally fucking communism. You don't matter or have any say in your life, only the mythological \"collective\" matters as far as your biology is concerned. This world is a total crap shot.\r\n\r\nThe truth hurts.

What happened to small government, individual liberty, free markets, free speech, and the constitution? It seems you've become obsessed and fixated with nothing but beating the other side lately, and have been resorting to authoritarian means to do so. Are you even conservatives anymore? I wouldn't say so, because this new philosophy doesn't at all align with founding values.</p>\n<p>Lately I've seen a lot of comments saying certain people should be banned from being able to hold office, serve in the military, or even be censored (<a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+Conservative/post/6ube/joe-biden-taps-transgender-official-as\">this thread </a> alone has many examples). I've even seen a few complaining about how there's too much diversity and that's our problem (it used to be <em>forced</em> diversity that was complained about, because it's annoying PC crap). Even the sidebar of this guild says \"no egalitarianism\", which used to be one of the constitutional pillars for conservatives, \"all men are created equal\" (to clarify: in the sense of equality, not equity). Support for limited government, individual rights, equality under the law, and free markets is waning. None of this was happening until about a year ago. Up until then, conservatives could be defined as rooted in the moderately libertarian founding values of the USA, with some republic thrown in as necessary. That's definitely not true anymore. Many conservatives had strong beliefs but it was vital that they not be forced on others like the Democrats do, especially by the government. But now many of you want just that. If I had seen conservatives just 5 years ago I wouldn't even recognize you now. What the fuck happened? Are you trying to actually become what the media has been slandering you as for all these years?</p>\n", "comment_count": 96, "created_utc": 1611076525, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1611083664, "fullname": "t2_6uha", "guild_id": "35", "guild_name": "UnpopularOpinion", "herald_guild": null, "id": "6uha", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/6uha/most-conservatives-are-now-just-rightwing", "score": 16, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Most conservatives are now just right-wing Democrats", "upvotes": 19, "url": ""}, "post_id": "6uha", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
