The real founders were actually pretty strange, Ben Franklin probably murdered someone and hid the body, George Washington owned slaves and passed a law limiting citizenship to white people (and even then only the ones he liked), Thomas Jefferson mutilated his bible, and Alexander Hamilton wanted a monarchy. And Sam Adams was a fucking lunatic who burned down his cousin John Adams's mansion over some argument. And they were almost all freemasons. Not that Britain was any better, they just weren't the godlike men they are portrayed as now (rebellions tend to need sketchy people like that too, Han Solo comes to mind).</p>\n", "created_utc": 1611155308, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_o88b", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1583035818, "description": "\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
