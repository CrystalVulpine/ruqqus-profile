Males have a collectivist function while females have a more individual one (counter-intuitive since females are much better at social interactions, but those are *private* interactions). So naturally, men get stuck with all the dirty jobs, the boredom, the propensity to be angry, the obligation to risk their lives and go through hell, the draft, not being allowed to have problems or emotions, the lack of natural talents and worse cognitive ability in exchange for the physical, the higher pain sensitivity, the ugliness, the 24/7 sex drive and hormones, all the responsibility, all the guilt, all the blame, the constant rage and depression, and pretty much everything bad. Females get a brain that specializes in personal functions, so they end up happy, talented, with brains that optimize for logic and creativity, better at almost everything, the good looks, the easy jobs, the far lower expectations, the permission to whine about the smallest things, the right to leech off of a man's labor, more career options (mostly due to having more biological talent), lower pain sensitivity, only having hormone issues once a month, the right to push all her problems on men, the emotional intelligence, and basically everything good. The ONLY advantages men have in an equal society are physical strength and not having to deal with a uterus. Almost everything else women have it 100% better. Men are the disposable sex, the modified form, the replaceable slaves, and the loss of a male is no big deal but the loss of a female is a tragedy. Think, 10 females and one male can have 10 pregnancies; but 1 female and 10 males can still only have one pregnancy. This is reflected in society: men, with all their other problems already, only have value in what they do; women are inherently priceless. Women and children first.

But similar to intelligence, the drastically higher expectations placed on men makes them seem better even though this isn't the case biologically; they have to manage it to survive.

With women, if one of the genes on the X chromosome becomes faulty, they have a healthy \u2018backup\u2019 copy. Men, on the other hand, have to make do with any faulty genes on their single X chromosome, which can put them at a greater risk of disease.\n\nFrom the moment they are a ball of cells, males are more vulnerable than females, with male babies at a 20 per cent greater risk of dying in the womb. But according to ageing expert Prof David Gems at University College London, mortality in men soars once puberty hits. Some of this is due to men\u2019s more risky behaviour, but studies suggest that long-term problems are caused by the physical changes in the body created by the hormone testosterone.\n\nA 2012 study of records from pre-19th-Century Korea showed that eunuchs who were castrated as boys before the testosterone surge of puberty, lived 14 to 19 years longer than their contemporaries.\n\nWith the life expectancy differences so tied up with hormones and genetics, it seems unlikely that men will ever close the gap entirely. But the good news is that not all of our ageing is predetermined. The Russian gap between the sexes, for instance, is thought to be due to the culture of heavy drinking and smoking. As cultures can change, it\u2019s possible for both sexes to live healthier lives with the genetic hand they are dealt. Meanwhile, advances in our treatment of diseases should help us to close the gap even further.\"\n\n\"[...] the gender differential in life expectancy from birth is about 6.5 years greater for women in the U.S., 5.3 years in the UK, 12 years in Russia, and about 6 months in India. This societal diversity implies that social factors have an influence on male and female longevity. While women have a biological advantage, historically certain living conditions and social customs tended to negate this benefit. For example, iron deficiency anemia due to female blood loss contributed in the past to excess female mortality. Social differences between men and women and the challenges of motherhood have further compromised women\u2019s biological advantage.\n\nFemale hormones, particularly estrogen, and the resiliency of the female body to accommodate pregnancy and breast-feeding are also thought to promote longevity. Estrogens have beneficial effects on lipids in the blood and seem to protect a woman from premature heart disease.\n\nMale behaviors tend to be riskier, and more men are exposed to hazards in the workplace. Men experience more motor vehicle accidents and have higher rates of alcoholism and smoking. In addition, males tend to drive more aggressively than females, and men on average smoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol than women. These excess risks in men tend to increase the likelihood of heart disease and malignancy.\n\nThe ways the genders relate to their bodies is another potential factor explaining male and female longevity differences. Women tend to be more health conscious and attend to their bodies, seeking preventive health care and practicing healthier lifestyles compared to men. Men relate to their bodies with strength and power and expose them to risks from early ages.\n\nAnother way to approach the longevity differential between women and men is to look at the causes of death across the life span. Graphs of mortality ratios by gender show excess male mortality by violence that peaks at 4:1 around age 30. Gender-specific mortality rates for the top 10 causes of death shows excess male-to-female ratio for all conditions except diabetes mellitus, for which the risk is identical. Whether this gender gap relates to biological differences or lifestyle choices such as cigarette smoking is a matter of debate. Perhaps diabetes in women somehow reduces the gender-specific advantage enjoyed by women for other diseases.\n\nNonetheless, the consequences of atherosclerosis clearly affect the longevity differential between men and women.
