If Dream is being employed by YouTube as I suspect they are, then it's not too big of a stretch to think that maybe YouTube or Dream is bribing the others to quit so the Dream Team gets more of the spotlight.</p>\n<p>Even popular channels outside of the minecraft realm are susceptible to this. In the past year alone, not only did nearly every popular minecraft channel quit at the same time, but SMG4 went more cringe than ever and started promoting Dream, SuperMarioLogan got a cease and desist and is likely to get terminated, tons of popular channels got terminated, and the ones that are left either quit or started worshipping Dream like crazy. ExplodingTNT \"took a break\" and Pink Sheep's videos suddenly went from hilarious to so cringe it had to have been on purpose, all at the exact same time he started shilling for Dream, and at the exact same time every other MC channel did the same thing.</p>\n", "comment_count": 2, "created_utc": 1614539805, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_80w0", "guild_id": "1f", "guild_name": "Conspiracy", "herald_guild": null, "id": "80w0", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Conspiracy/post/80w0/dream-is-a-paid-shill-and", "score": 9, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Dream is a paid shill and employee of YouTube/Google", "upvotes": 11, "url": ""}, "post_id": "80w0", "score": 3, "upvotes": 3, "voted": 0}
