Look, no one said it was easy. No one said it feels good or aligns in any way with your primal instincts. But it's the right thing to do, because otherwise you'd be just as guilty yourself. Two wrongs do not make a right. Second point however is inaccurate and due to a mistranslation caused by our puritanical sexual culture. The original text says \"longing\" in the context of adultery, meaning wishing another woman could be your wife, which is disloyal to your current one. Because it's not the physical action that matters, but what's in the heart.
