Parents don't like their daughters going out with boys, everywhere has rules limiting boys' contact with girls (even more so in the olden days than now), etc. People have never trusted males because the females are more valuable and it's in our instincts to protect them as much as possible. This is the one disadvantage women have in society, overprotection.

Because from day one, they're pampered and told they're super special just for existing. They can get anything they want, and they deserve it, and if they don't they can just cry about it and everyone will rush to do their bidding. They are taught that they are entitled to not face the hard realities of life. Their parents, teachers, bosses, etc. coddle them immensely just because they're girls. They are rarely expected to endure stress or worry unless they decide to raise children. If they act lazy, selfish, manipulative, and do nothing with their lives but leech off of mens' labor society doesn't bat an eye, and even encourages this. Parents harshly punish their sons unfairly but let their daughters deliberately do whatever they want and *protect* them from the consequences. They can get away with horrific crimes without even an arrest, often accusing a male victim successfully; and even if they are sentenced it is 1/6th the amount a man would get for the exact same thing. And if the women aren't happy it's the end of the world, men who the fuck cares. Even in societies that oppressed them, much of this still held true. This is not only completely unfair to men, but makes the women grow into adults still being less mature than an 8-year-old boy; not because that's how they're made as some often assert, as actually females are *more* mature by nature; but because they're allowed to act that way.

Because from day one, they're pampered and told they're super special just for existing. They can get anything they want, and they deserve it, and if they don't they can just cry about it and everyone will rush to do their bidding. They are taught that they are entitled to not face the hard realities of life. Their parents, teachers, bosses, etc. coddle them immensely just because they're girls. They are rarely expected to endure stress or worry unless they decide to raise children. If they act lazy, selfish, manipulative, and do nothing with their lives but leech off of mens' labor society doesn't bat an eye, and even encourages this. Parents harshly punish their sons unfairly but let their daughters deliberately do whatever they want and <em>protect</em> them from the consequences. They can get away with horrific crimes without even an arrest, often accusing a male victim successfully; and even if they are sentenced it is 1/6th the amount a man would get for the exact same thing.
