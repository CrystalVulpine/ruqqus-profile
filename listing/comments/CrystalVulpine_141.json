And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace\u2014as in all the congregations of the Lord\u2019s people.\r\n> \r\n> Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.\r\n> \r\n> Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord\u2019s command. But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored...\r\n\r\nNow why the hell would Paul be talking about orderly prophesying in church, then suddenly say \"Oh by the way women aren't people\" and then continue on his argument about orderly prophesying as if he never stopped? That makes NO sense for a person writing a letter to a church, but it *does* make sense that a later church father who associated women with Marcionism could've added it, as was a common practice in ancient times. Plus, the \"law\" he is referring to is no biblical law as Paul usually uses it. It is the law of the Roman Empire, and the writer here gives no indication that he is using \"law\" differently, as we would expect of the same author.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 11\r\n\r\n\r\n> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.\r\n> \r\n> But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head\u2014it is the same as having her head shaved. For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice\u2014nor do the churches of God.\r\n> \r\n> But in the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it...\r\n\r\nYet again we have an abrupt ending of the topic at hand, a passage about women being lesser creatures, and then a sudden continuation of the previous matter as if the topic had never changed in the first place. Again, does it make any sense for me to put something completely unrelated in my argument here? No, but it does make sense if someone is trying to add it to the text. The original read much more clearly \"I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. But in the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good...\". There is another problem with this passage: it condemns long hair on men and short hair on women. However if you remember you could take a special Nazarite vow which included not cutting your hair. This is what Sampson was. Paul himself, according to some sources, was a Nazarite. Jesus was also likely one. So this does not make any sense as being from Paul.\r\n\r\n1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, Jude, James, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John: These are almost certainly not written by who they say they are. Maybe Revelation, Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians too. In ancient times it was a common practice for someone who considered themselves a follower of someone to, after the real person had died, continue their work for them, which included writing under their name. Forgery too, was also common.\r\n\r\nIt also appears that most of the old testament laws were forgeries. The oldest Biblical characters had no awareness of almost any of them, even the super important ones. For example, being born a Moabite was condemned, non-Levites were to be stoned to death for approaching priestly areas, eunuchs were abominations, and even having a physical impairment, such as blindness, or being a woman, defiled you. Yet David was half Moabite, and so were his priests. The prophets praise eunuchs. People who suffer impairments are thought to be rewarded, not condemned. Deborah was a judge and there were plenty of prophetesses. God told Jeremiah that he never gave any instructions for animal sacrifice or burning people, but that the lying pen of scribes had made it so as they did more evil than their ancestors in Egypt. And this was just after a very sketchy incident where Josiah \"found\" a book of law that had somehow only had a single copy and been misplaced in the temple; just in time for him to implement his desired reforms and give himself more power. This lines up almost perfectly with scholarship, which has found multiple sources for the old testament books and agrees with Jeremiah that the laws were from later sources.", "body_html": "<p>Well let's see:</p>\n<p>1 Corinthians 14</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace\u2014as in all the congregations of the Lord\u2019s people.</p>\n<p>Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</p>\n<p>Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord\u2019s command. But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now why the hell would Paul be talking about orderly prophesying in church, then suddenly say \"Oh by the way women aren't people\" and then continue on his argument about orderly prophesying as if he never stopped? That makes NO sense for a person writing a letter to a church, but it <em>does</em> make sense that a later church father who associated women with Marcionism could've added it, as was a common practice in ancient times.

It is the law of the Roman Empire, and the writer here gives no indication that he is using \"law\" differently, as we would expect of the same author.</p>\n<p>1 Corinthians 11</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.</p>\n<p>But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
