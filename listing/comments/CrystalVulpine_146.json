I spent the first 18 years of my life as a girl/woman and these last 2 as a man.\r\n\r\nMy experiences as a woman:\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n\r\nMost people treated me very well and those who didn't mistreated me because I'm autistic, not because I was a girl. I was never made to feel bad whenever I asked for help and when I did people were happy to help me. Guys were happy to help with emotional issues particularly. They were always happy to be there for me if I needed to talk. Overall my mental health and well-being was taken more seriously. Additionally it was easier to make friends. It just seemed like others were more comfortable around me and felt safe to open up more around me.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n\r\nNothing really. I never experienced misogyny ( and I grew up in yeehaw land). I wasn't exactly attractive so I never received sexual/romantic attention from guys be it positive or negative. When it came to other girls, there were a few that were shitty but I think this too would have been worse if I was attractive as they would see me as competition.\r\n\r\nMy experiences as a man:\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n\r\nSocially, nothing really improved. I hear some people say that men are taken more seriously, especially when it comes to the work place. But at my work men and women are treated the same. I am more confident now but that's because my gender dysphoria has lessoned considerably.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n\r\nI don't ask for help much anymore, especially when it comes to my mental health. Whenever I do ask for help, people are less enthusiastic about helping me. And I've also noticed that the quality of help I receive has decreased. I find that it's harder to talk to people. They just don't seem as comfortable around me anymore nor does it seem that they trust me nearly as much. it's hard to make friends compared to a couple of years ago. People just treat me neutrally and sometimes even negatively. I noticed strangers are more wary around me. Nothing like pulling their kids closer or clutching their purses tighter, but they stay farther away and don't make as much eye contact (not that I mind, but I'm sure many people would).\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\r\n\r\nIt was a very jarring experience. I went from being treated how a person should be treated (trusted, listened to, supported, etc.) To being treated like, well, a man. In my experience I've been treated far worse as a man. I by no means regret transitioning in any way, but I do wish that someone would have warned me about this.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, my experiences are my own. For some people it can be very different. Additionally, I've only been treated as a man for 2 years now. Maybe that \"male privilege\" I've been hearing about will kick in soon /s.
