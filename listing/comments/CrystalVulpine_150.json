However, what I do know is that it's hypocritical how much churchy people constantly bash \"the gays\" while being involved in immoral practices themselves. \"But we're all sinners though,\" they say, but these two things are somehow different. I also feel like if they're going judge others based on the OT law, they'd better be following all the other 611 laws too, including the ones about not eating pig meat and not getting out of bed on Saturday, which I can guarantee you 99% of them aren't. I don't recall God ever saying which OT laws still apply and which ones don't, so it's all or nothing, either the whole OT law is still in effect or it's not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yuo are rejecting the teachings of St. Paul on this.</p>\n<p>Then, why believe in Christianity at all?
