And I also realize that letters written by disciples are not on the same authority as Jesus is, they are just typical preaching. It's an overall message, not letter by letter accuracy, especially not through translation.\r\n\r\nDeny it all you want, but there are thousands of variants, plenty of them having theological implications. And the further back you go, the more variants would've existed. Our earliest full texts only date from the 300s btw, plenty of time for the Catholic church to take over and destroy any deviant copies, which we can already prove happened with multiple known versions, such as Marcion, the gospel of the Hebrews, etc. Even with that, there are several different text types that still exist today. And even within the non-varying text, there are tons of internal contradictions from different authors with different ideas, and scribal additions. You cannot claim that every letter is accurate.\r\n\r\n> I am quite sure that God is powerful enough to watch over the ages and make sure that the words in Bible are true and correct.\r\n\r\nHe is, but you're assuming he sanctioned the bible when he didn't. It didn't even exist until 382 AD! Before that were individual scriptures coming in multiple different versions, most of which were disputed. In fact, he says the opposite in Jeremiah 8:8, warning of such tampering.\r\n\r\n> How else would then be possible for people to even know Him?\r\n\r\nHe still had a plan. Fortunately, scribes added more material than they omitted. So with the help of the holy spirit you can discern truth from lie. It may be a test, whether we will follow vain idols and traditions of men with excuses like \"it's in the bible!\" or him.\r\n\r\n> Besides, the punishment for altering the Bible is stated in there,\r\n\r\nImplying it's possible to do so...\r\n\r\n> You wouldn't know anything at all about Christianity if it didn't survive to this day.\r\n\r\n> I believe God is just and gives everyone who ever lived on this planet at least one chance in their life where they experience something which can lead them to surrendering their lives to Him.\r\n\r\nYou have contradicted yourself. First you say it's impossible without Christianity and the bible, then you say it is.

And I also realize that letters written by disciples are not on the same authority as Jesus is, they are just typical preaching. It's an overall message, not letter by letter accuracy, especially not through translation.</p>\n<p>Deny it all you want, but there are thousands of variants, plenty of them having theological implications. And the further back you go, the more variants would've existed. Our earliest full texts only date from the 300s btw, plenty of time for the Catholic church to take over and destroy any deviant copies, which we can already prove happened with multiple known versions, such as Marcion, the gospel of the Hebrews, etc. Even with that, there are several different text types that still exist today. And even within the non-varying text, there are tons of internal contradictions from different authors with different ideas, and scribal additions. You cannot claim that every letter is accurate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am quite sure that God is powerful enough to watch over the ages and make sure that the words in Bible are true and correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is, but you're assuming he sanctioned the bible when he didn't. It didn't even exist until 382 AD! Before that were individual scriptures coming in multiple different versions, most of which were disputed. In fact, he says the opposite in Jeremiah 8:8, warning of such tampering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How else would then be possible for people to even know Him?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He still had a plan. Fortunately, scribes added more material than they omitted. So with the help of the holy spirit you can discern truth from lie.

In 1939, a Los Angeles woman went to jail for wearing slacks to court, the judge citing them as a distraction from the ongoing legal business at hand. Women in the United States Congress were barred from wearing pants on the Senate floor until the 1993 \u201cPantsuit Rebellion\u201d overturned the archaic rule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019d be naive to think women\u2019s garb isn\u2019t policed in the new millennia: In 2009, a Sudanese woman was fined (but avoided whipping) for wearing green slacks, which violated \u201cpublic decency laws\u201d; a rule adopted in 2017 for women pro golfers stipulated they could be fined for wearing leggings; and, speaking of leggings, some now see them as the anti-pants pants \u2014 as oppressive as corsets and gowns, according to one New York Times opinion writer, whose recent \u201cyoga pants are bad for women\u201d Op-Ed ignited controversy around the matter. You get the idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again as <a href=\"https://history.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">history.com</a> notes, Joan of Arc was <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/joan-arc-burned-stake\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft and violating divine law for dressing like a man</a> - so it was seen for a long time as being wrong for women to dress like men (and wearing pants would probably fall in to being a violation of that).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And why doesn't the same principle apply for men?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it doesn't apply, it may be because there is a legit double standard and women and men are different. But it also might be the case that men are criticized for wearing women's dress, like that whole Harry Styles incident of him wearing a dress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/conservatives-mock-harry-styles-wearing-170000012.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conservatives Mock Harry Styles for Wearing Dress on the Cover of Vogue</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people think cards and even dice are inherently satanic, including childrens' toys</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't remember reading about this in too much detail but I think playing cards and tarot cards have a common origin of creation. I can understand some caution with playing cards - not games like solitaire, but gambling can cause a lot of problems for people, so if they banned playing with cards entirely to try to prevent the kids from getting in to gambling, I could understand that. I'm sure there are some \"problematic\" children's toys, like \"ouija boards\", so toys would have to be seen on a case by case basis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because you see a website that presents itself as \"Christian\" and automatically believe everything it says as true. Or a TV preacher or radio show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel that's unfair to say as I tried to detail the logical reasons why I thought the information I saw would lead me to conclude there are problems with rock music.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1618322813, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_vsif", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "vsif", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 4, "parent_comment_id": ["vsd5"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/9psl/does-anyone-feel-rock-music-is/vsif", "post_id": "9psl", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["vsif"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/9psl/does-anyone-feel-rock-music-is/vt4m", "post": {"author_name": "owlie", "award_count": 0, "body": "This would go for certain other musical forms as well.\r\n\r\nI kind of agree in theory, but in practice am not always sure where the line should be drawn.\r\n\r\nConsider some arguments against rock music (specifically):\r\n\r\nThe \"and Roll\" in \"Rock n' Roll\" referred to fornication: \r\n\r\n> Many people don't know that the term rock-n-roll was also a slang word for [the reproductive act] in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
