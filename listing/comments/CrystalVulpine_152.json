There are other \"yogas\" which aren't stretching (\"karma yoga\" is a yoga of working as religious practice, or \"raja yoga\" which I think is some kind of intellectual activity). Maybe like someone might say they want to play \"Nintendo\" when they mean video games in general (actually this analogy is backwards, from a particular to a general term, whereas \"yoga\" is a general term being used for the specific term of \"hatha yoga\"). Anyway, \"hatha yoga\" isn't just stretching, but is a religious practice of hindus. So, it seems like that would be avoided by Christians as being directly non-Christian, or at least due to doubt that some kind of conflicting practice wouldn't be mixed in. \r\n\r\nNow, the only overlap I'd like to mention is, say I do a non-yoga stretch, and then it's almost the same as or is the same as some kind of yoga stretch. I imagine there are a limit of the amount of effective stretches that exist. I guess it could end up being like \"doing yoga without doing yoga\", if that makes any sense. It's not like hindus or the hindu religion get to trademark the stretches as part of their religion, and if you do a stretch that overlaps with a yoga stretch, I don't think it's yoga exactly. \r\n\r\nMeditation, or specifically \"transcendental meditation\" is a Buddhist religious practice. Sometimes, either yoga or meditation are part of other non-Christian religious traditions (New Age practice comes to mind). Again, it would seem that there could be conflicts with views here, whereas sometimes Buddhist monks might meditate for hours a day instead of pray for hours a day as Christian monks would do, due to different fundamental beliefs that lead to different actions. It seems Christians should avoid meditative practices.\r\n\r\nAnother confusion is the word \"meditation\", which in the West is used to mean \"meditative prayer\", which is something different entirely. (For the Catholic view, see [\"mental prayer\" on the prayer encyclopedia entry](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm)). I suspect the buddhist word of \"meditation\" may be a deliberately chosen confused translation, but I don't really know for sure, if anyone has any knowledge on the history of translating the word.\r\n\r\nAs with yoga, meditation seems to have an overlap with non-meditative relaxation.

I don't think it's needed - you can stretch without yoga, and relax without meditation. That seems enough to me, and I don't see a compelling reason why Christians should practice yoga and meditation when they have ties to non-Christian religions. \r\n\r\nDo you think that Christians should avoid yoga and meditation? What other topics should be mentioned for discussion?", "body_html": "<p>It seems Christians should avoid yoga and meditation, but stretching that isn't yoga is ok, as well as relaxing that isn't meditation - the key would be not adding in the Hindu or Buddhist influences.</p>\n<p>\"Yoga\" refers to \"hatha yoga\", a hindu kind of stretching. There are other \"yogas\" which aren't stretching (\"karma yoga\" is a yoga of working as religious practice, or \"raja yoga\" which I think is some kind of intellectual activity). Maybe like someone might say they want to play \"Nintendo\" when they mean video games in general (actually this analogy is backwards, from a particular to a general term, whereas \"yoga\" is a general term being used for the specific term of \"hatha yoga\"). Anyway, \"hatha yoga\" isn't just stretching, but is a religious practice of hindus. So, it seems like that would be avoided by Christians as being directly non-Christian, or at least due to doubt that some kind of conflicting practice wouldn't be mixed in.</p>\n<p>Now, the only overlap I'd like to mention is, say I do a non-yoga stretch, and then it's almost the same as or is the same as some kind of yoga stretch. I imagine there are a limit of the amount of effective stretches that exist. I guess it could end up being like \"doing yoga without doing yoga\", if that makes any sense. It's not like hindus or the hindu religion get to trademark the stretches as part of their religion, and if you do a stretch that overlaps with a yoga stretch, I don't think it's yoga exactly.</p>\n<p>Meditation, or specifically \"transcendental meditation\" is a Buddhist religious practice. Sometimes, either yoga or meditation are part of other non-Christian religious traditions (New Age practice comes to mind). Again, it would seem that there could be conflicts with views here, whereas sometimes Buddhist monks might meditate for hours a day instead of pray for hours a day as Christian monks would do, due to different fundamental beliefs that lead to different actions. It seems Christians should avoid meditative practices.</p>\n<p>Another confusion is the word \"meditation\", which in the West is used to mean \"meditative prayer\", which is something different entirely. (For the Catholic view, see <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"mental prayer\" on the prayer encyclopedia entry</a>). I suspect the buddhist word of \"meditation\" may be a deliberately chosen confused translation, but I don't really know for sure, if anyone has any knowledge on the history of translating the word.</p>\n<p>As with yoga, meditation seems to have an overlap with non-meditative relaxation. It's not exactly the same as meditation to close your eyes, relax, take some deep breaths, and clear your mind, or \"zone out\" - although these seem to overlap with Buddhist meditation. Again, I don't think Buddhists have a \"trademark\" on relaxation, but it seems the Eastern tradition has made it in to a major practice of their religion.</p>\n<p>I think it has been concerning to see yoga and meditation casually suggested as \"therapies\" for those with mental issues today; it seems to create more and more of divides between Christian and non-Christian society (although there are some non-Christian therapists who might have the open mind enough to understand a potential conflict exists between these suggestions and the faith of a Christian patient).</p>\n<p>Now, on the other hand, Christianity has had a tendency to \"baptize\" certain things (to take a non-Christian thing and make it in to a Christian thing), so I don't know if that could be done with yoga and meditation, but I don't think it has been done at present. I don't think it's needed - you can stretch without yoga, and relax without meditation. That seems enough to me, and I don't see a compelling reason why Christians should practice yoga and meditation when they have ties to non-Christian religions.</p>\n<p>Do you think that Christians should avoid yoga and meditation?

The federalists forced us to only forbid the government from infringing on 10 rights, and they are so littered with vague and subjective exceptions that the government can always find a loophole to not protect it.

But there are exceptions, and that's the part they don't teach you in school. These exceptions include \"obscenity, fraud, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law\". Btw, that first one, \"obscenity\" is just an archaic term for what we would now call \"offensive\". Is this starting to sound familiar? It should to anyone familiar with reddit. The right basically exists only on paper. And every other right we supposedly have is too. Are they generally protected? From other people, yes, but not when the government doesn't like it! And now, the federalists have forced us to compromise to the point where they control two puppet parties and every politician to do their bidding. And they sent us into a state of moral panic to trick us into thinking it's \"necessary\" to save society. To the leftists, they say white men and muh racism and muh sexism and snowflakephobia is running rampant in everything, and the only way to stop it is to elect political tyrants who promise to crack down. To the right, they say society is infected with gays and trans and feminists and degenerates, and that they will destroy society, and the only way to stop it is to elect tyrannical politicians who will crack down. And it's all a lie, to keep the elites in power while controlling our lives and enjoying our tax dollars, and keep us distracted from it.
