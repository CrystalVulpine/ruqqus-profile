What's bizarre is that it often agrees with *Luke* over Matthew when using the Q source. Interesting, because often the Lukan version is more primitive and Hebraic than the Matthean version. I don't just mean minor details either. For example, the part where the people ask John what to do in chapter 3 is not extant in canonical Matthew, but it *is* in Luke...and a shorter version is also found in Hebrew Matthew! My guess is that Q was originally written in Hebrew, and that Shem Tob's text made use of this or padded it out with translations of the parts of Mark that were incorporated. And Matthew and Luke both made use of some sort of Greek translation of this document. More evidence is that the Shem Tob version also has several agreements with the gospel of Thomas over the canonical gospels, which also utilized Q. As well as agreements with long lost manuscripts not available in his time, so these variants could not have been the results of tampering by Jewish scribes (which did happen, as it also did to the canonical version by Roman scribes).\r\n\r\nSome of these old manuscripts also appear to be checked against older sources, including Q, and often the original Hebrew version too. Sinaiticus and Bezae in particular have several variants in the synoptic gospels and even Acts which come from older versions than are available to us today, and updates from source documents that were originally erroneously copied. Some manuscripts of the Old Latin and Old Syriac have similar variants.\r\n\r\nThe gospel of the Hebrews, too, looks like it made use of this document, or an extremely early version of Luke. I cannot say it *is* Q, as it's definitely edited and harmonized from the existing gospels, but in places it gives a more primitive reading.

Even if hell was mentioned, there is even less indication of an \"end of grace\" that everyone seems to think is going to happen, as if Jesus's sacrifice wasn't good enough. Actually the gospels mention Jesus evangelizing to the dead before his resurrection, which would be pointless if it was too late for them. And don't start telling me about Tribulation, because the whole point of that is to try and convince people to change their minds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea about original greek, but there are numerous places where hell is described in parables by Jesus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See that's kinda the problem, the translations are in many places dishonest and swayed by the beliefs of the translators. When you see \"hell\" in your bible, know that it's actually either the grave, Hades, or Gehenna. Only the devil is said to be tortured \"forever\" in the \"lake of fire\" and the authenticity of Revelation is itself questionable.</p>\n<p>The grave: Figurative place where dead people are, or the state of being dead, and in the old testament everyone goes there. You probably already know. It's pretty safe to rule this out.</p>\n<p>Hades: Greek place of the dead, used to translate the former term. Usually it is used for the same purpose, not as much for the Greek concept of it with the underworld.</p>\n<p>Gehenna: Hell is right here on Earth, apparently. This is a valley where the Pharisees burned people who they ostracized as \"sinners\". It was regarded as cursed for that reason. The new testament sometimes alludes to it as either a place of death and complete destruction or a tragic fate of not being allowed to enter the kingdom, depending on the interpretation. Not where God mercilessly burns people forever.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1619050596, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_wh71", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1583035818, "description": "\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
