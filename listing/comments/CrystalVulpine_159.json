Shall I then take away the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Far from it! 16Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, \u201cThe two will become one flesh.\u201d 17But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him. 18Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 19Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? 20For you have been bought for a price: therefore glorify God in your body.\r\n\r\nBasically, the point being made by verses 18-20 is \"Outsiders are seeing this and they're going to think this is what Christians do!
