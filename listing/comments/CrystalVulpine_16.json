Happy to be here!\r\n\r\nI was able to set an image now that I have 300 rep (for profile photo, that is). I noticed it doesn't cleanly crop (and I am assuming it automatically crops the center, which may or may not be what users expect)...even with circular photos or transparent backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could have a thing where you upload a photo and select the area you want to crop to use? Also, not sure about the white jagged dots/lines that happen now, but depending on how it works it could be a CSS thing, or something in the code if it actually does a crop in the back-end.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, just a thought or two, nothing that is a deal-breaker. I love this platform already and will be donating monthly to see it's continued success.\r\n\r\neat some broccoli. \r\n\r\nEDIT: If you add a white border around your photo, it blends the white noise and looks perfect.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Looks like the site automatically scales the photo to a resolution and uses that.
