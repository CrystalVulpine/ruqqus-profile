Usually this is a very narrow set of girly behaviors that are allowed for you to fit into their social circle, otherwise you won't fit in at all.

Oddly enough I lack most sexual instincts too, like showing off status or wanting to look attractive. I've never felt protective of women. I could have an adopted kid and legit don't see the difference between that and a biological child, yet apparently that's supposed to be a big deal or something? Other people sometimes talk about their crushes and romantic dreams like it's natural for them and I'm just completely lost.</p>\n<p>I don't feel abnormal but I learned that according to every tenant of biology I'm an absolute anomaly. And then I realized that I've never really met hardly anyone else over the age of 12 who shares my experience. Is this a defect or are other people just acting and playing some weird game?</p>\n", "comment_count": 48, "created_utc": 1622647196, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_bsc4", "guild_id": "1v", "guild_name": "AskRuqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "bsc4", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/bsc4/is-it-normal-to-be-an", "score": 15, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Is it normal to be an adult male and have almost zero interest in sex?", "upvotes": 16, "url": ""}, "post_id": "bsc4", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
