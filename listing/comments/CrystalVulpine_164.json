Every one of those is a tyrant controlling everyone and squashing their opposition. In the name of glory or the \"common good\". 1 Timothy sets up the same power hierarchy and tells everyone to obey it...and in a personal letter to a friend? Why would Paul give his instructions for running the entire church in a personal letter? Wouldn't it make like a LOT more sense to do that in a public letter? And one that actually matches his writing style and doesn't use words that didn't exist until decades after his death? It's pretty obvious that it's not legit. In order to fully understand the problem, you have to be aware of what Christianity looked like in those days. It was still full of wildly different beliefs, and the orthodoxy was just beginning to form and sought centralized control and an organized church for the first time. 1 Timothy is an early attempt to discredit ideas the church considered heresy (some of them rightfully but that's no excuse to defraud), and give the church leaders more power. 1 Timothy very specifically attacks schools of thought which did not surface until after Paul's death, specifically those which relied heavily on his authentic letters, and directly contradicts Paul and early Christianity many times. Also consider that in ancient times, it wasn't considered forgery to write in someone's name if it was deemed \"good\", and combined with the lack of information in those days it was quite easy to get away with it.\r\n\r\n> So much, they made zero additional excerpts for all-people/for-leaders except for a comma, which would be seen as inclusion rather than elevation. Is it more probable that, with an unbiased gaze, these forgers decided to give authority incredible power by inserting a prayer request for the people who lead and their own region, without more than an inclusion in \"all people,\" or that Paul included it to help a region to be governed by prayer, so the decisions made would be godly?\r\n\r\nIt is setting up the idea that those leaders are more valuable and worth more than everyone else. It only includes \"all people\" at all to fool those such as yourself, by \"proving\" that's not what it's saying, but still subconsciously steering the priority toward elite figures.\r\n\r\n> Luckily, this expert forger decided not to include any economic, or otherwise political policy, and rather ideals that correlate with the bible.\r\n\r\nThey have a lot of ideals which correlate with church tradition, but no earlier than that. Most of what people think the bible says is actually what their favorite televangelist told them it says. For example I bet you didn't know that:\r\n\r\n* The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)\r\n\r\n* Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)\r\n\r\n* God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)\r\n\r\n* Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)\r\n\r\n* Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\r\n\r\n* The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, *before* the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\r\n\r\nNow let's review 1 Timothy's \"biblical\" requirements:\r\n\r\n> \u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f21\u03c3\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u1fb3 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u1fc3 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u1fc7\u00b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72 \u03b1\u1f50\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u2019 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f21\u03c3\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u1fb3. \u1f08\u03b4\u1f70\u03bc \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7, \u03b5\u1f36\u03c4\u03b1 \u0395\u1f54\u03b1. \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f08\u03b4\u1f70\u03bc \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f20\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7, \u1f21 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u1f74 \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u00b7 \u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f10\u1f70\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f01\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2.\r\n\r\nLiterally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital; 1 Corinthians 14:33b-35 is an abrupt insertion to the original letter. Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved, in direct contradiction not only to Jesus but also Paul himself in 1 Corinthians 7. To be fair it's possible this passage is also a later insertion, as it jumps quite profoundly from matters of decency to office qualifications, but it's more likely a bridging device for the next topic.\r\n\r\n> \u03b5\u1f34 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c1\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6. \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b9\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1, \u03bd\u03b7\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c3\u03ce\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1, \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6, \u1f04\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd,\r\n\r\nThis criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff.

Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\r\n\r\n> \u03bc\u1f74 \u03bd\u03b5\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c6\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u1fc3 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5.\r\n\r\nPaul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians.

The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\r\n\r\n> Verse? What exactly contradicts this in Matthew 23?\r\n\r\nThe entire chapter.

Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let's review 1 Timothy's \"biblical\" requirements:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f21\u03c3\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u1fb3 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u1fc3 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u1fc7\u00b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72 \u03b1\u1f50\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u2019 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f21\u03c3\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u1fb3. \u1f08\u03b4\u1f70\u03bc \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7, \u03b5\u1f36\u03c4\u03b1 \u0395\u1f54\u03b1. \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f08\u03b4\u1f70\u03bc \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f20\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7, \u1f21 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u1f74 \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u00b7 \u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f10\u1f70\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f01\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Literally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital; 1 Corinthians 14:33b-35 is an abrupt insertion to the original letter. Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved, in direct contradiction not only to Jesus but also Paul himself in 1 Corinthians 7. To be fair it's possible this passage is also a later insertion, as it jumps quite profoundly from matters of decency to office qualifications, but it's more likely a bridging device for the next topic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u03b5\u1f34 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f40\u03c1\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6. \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b9\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1, \u03bd\u03b7\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c3\u03ce\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1, \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6, \u1f04\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ca\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u1fc7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u03bc\u1f74 \u03bd\u03b5\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c6\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u1fc3 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f14\u03be\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f40\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verse?

The sledgehammer angst and cheap drama of the first chapter lead me to suspect that the player will be encouraged to hate the Patriarch and all that he stands for, and to see cooperation with him as tragic. However, the game is not very interesting, so it is not likely that I will play most of it.</p>\n<p>The people who made this game have some rabid fans who will praise it regardless of how it plays or what the story is like. The game makers had always been fans of cheap melodrama and sledgehammer angst, but to the best of my knowledge this is the first time they have nailed their rainbow-striped Pride flag to their mast.</p>\n<p>A further note on the idiocy of the development team:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8</a></p>\n<p>One often-repeated piece of music is a version of an old Christian hymn. It is played by murderous Christians who all happen to be white. And yet ... the lyrics include the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have you learned to love your neighbours, of all colors, creeds and kind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've learned to love my people, of all colors, creeds and kinds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I take \"my people\" to mean \"Christian people,\" but maybe it's even broader than that. It might have been intended to mean that Christians love everyone, even non-Christians.</p>\n<p>So Christianity, which emphasized loyalty to spiritual brotherhood rather than racial brotherhood, actually put that emphasis into its hymns. Then some people who hate Christians stole the hymn for use in an anti-Christian game that implies all Christians are whites who hate non-whites. And yet they didn't bother to notice the lyrics which say that Christians love other Christians of all colors, creeds, and kinds.</p>\n<p>Finally, as far as I can tell, the game is not buggy on PC, just boring. However, metacritic is full of complaints from console users that the game is buggy on consoles.</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>Yeah, sorry to bother you all with this, I just needed to vent somewhere.</p>\n", "comment_count": 39, "created_utc": 1623763121, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1623763250, "fullname": "t2_c2io", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "c2io", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/c2io/people-who-hate-christians-have-made", "score": 29, "thumb_url": null, "title": "people who hate Christians have made another video game", "upvotes": 31, "url": ""}, "post_id": "c2io", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}

Combined with the emphasis on church officials being male, it's pretty obviously an attempt to fuse Roman pater-familias culture with church doctrine. Familial relations and maximizing procreation and breeding were abolished by the early Christians but extremely central to Greco-Roman culture.\r\n\r\n> ...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?\r\n\r\nIf he doesn't then why has he not resigned?\r\n\r\n> Considering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.\r\n\r\nOutsiders will always claim a good person is evil.

All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\n\nIt's ironic. Though I'm accussed of only listening to my favorite televangelists, you made a claim from biblical critics and simply wrote \"are judged\" as though it's the consensus of biblical scholars. \n\n> The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, before the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\n\nThat just sounds like a stretch. Where did he declare the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot?\n\n> Literally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital\n\nConsidering various teachings of Jesus being new, why would teachings upon an almost completely new church be such an outrageous idea?\n\n> Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved.\n\nYes, \"literally\" in the sense of removing context to prove a point.\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Directly prior to the verse: For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.\n\n2. This is further mentioned in 1 Timothy 5:14-15: So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. For some have already strayed after Satan.\n\n3. In 1 Timothy 4:16: Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save (sozo) both yourself and your hearers. When in the context of it's own book, it certaintly does give more of a case to spiritual preservation rather than the \"not saving by faith\" idea, the idea that contradicts the church in the forgery \"decades after his death.\"\n\n> This criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.\n\nIt's almost as though it's to prevent the corruption of those who teach what they do not do, otherwise the teachers of the law in Jesus' time.\n\n> The next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\n\nLet's actually read what Paul said about marriage:\n\nNow concerning the matters about which you wrote: \u201cIt is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.\u201d 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\n\nTo the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.\n\nAgain, being accused of not reading the bible... though the idea that Paul wanted to keep church leaders from sexual immorality isn't even taken into consideration.\n\n> Paul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.\n\n...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?\n\n> This is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\n\nConsidering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.\n\n> Finally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\n\nEntire context and verse:\n\nThen Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, \u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\nWhile taking this section out of context, I wonder if \"call no man your father/instructor was taken literally as well...\nWhen we look at this scripture without a bias, and entirely in context, we find that these were all titles used to exalt instructors, and have a final consensus that we we should not exalt ourselves as the Pharisees were.\n\n> The entire chapter. You've been fooled yet again, this time into thinking that the bible is just a collection of a bunch of contextless sentences called verses. \n\nBelieve it or not, I understand the meaning of context. It also doesn't seem wise to read a whole chapter, see no stance against the allied argument, then decide the opposing argument must be true because they said \"It's the whole chapter!\"", "body_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Come on. Every one of those is a tyrant controlling everyone and squashing their opposition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That makes the biblically-strong-leader = tyrant? How does that begin to follow?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and in a personal letter to a friend?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be inaccurate to just call Timothy \"a friend.\" Timothy was a disciple, the son of a Jewish woman and Greek man, met by Paul in Acts, whom he references in Timothy. Timothy was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium, and was specifically said to be taken with Paul as Acts continues, leading to a couple of undesigned coincidences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wouldn't it make like a LOT more sense to do that in a public letter?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should Paul have attempted to make an announcement rather than instruct a letter to his diciple? That would depend on if it would have been more efficient to his time, and publicised. Obviously, we know it was successful on both fronts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And one that actually matches his writing style and doesn't use words that didn't exist until decades after his death? It's pretty obvious that it's not legit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Neat, it would be nice to know your definite proof that he used words that didn't exist until decades after his death.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also consider that in ancient times, it wasn't considered forgery to write in someone's name if it was deemed \"good\", and combined with the lack of information in those days it was quite easy to get away with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, adding to the Word of God wasn't exactly praised.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 Timothy very specifically attacks schools of thought which did not surface until after Paul's death, specifically those which relied heavily on his authentic letters, and directly contradicts Paul and early Christianity many times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Great, what are those schools of thought that he couldn't have known about, and what are those contradictions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of what people think the bible says is actually what their favorite televangelist told them it says. For example I bet you didn't know that:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>christian agrees with popular biblical interpretation, therefore hasn't read bible</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Copyists\" isn't synonymous with \"scribe.\" These were interpreters and, in their interpretations, essentially false teachers, a common idea in the bible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...Yeah?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also concealed or deliberately mistranslated in Leviticus, Genesis, Hebrews...?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Huh?\nDeuteronomy 17:14-15\nEven without the context of Deuteronomy, this is read as a very situational passage. Going into a passage, especially a situational one, with the intent to prove a point rather than find the original idea of the passage isn't going to be helpful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's ironic. Though I'm accussed of only listening to my favorite televangelists, you made a claim from biblical critics and simply wrote \"are judged\" as though it's the consensus of biblical scholars.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, before the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That just sounds like a stretch. Where did he declare the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Literally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Considering various teachings of Jesus being new, why would teachings upon an almost completely new church be such an outrageous idea?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, \"literally\" in the sense of removing context to prove a point.</p>\n<p>We know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Directly prior to the verse: For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is further mentioned in 1 Timothy 5:14-15: So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. For some have already strayed after Satan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In 1 Timothy 4:16: Watch your life and doctrine closely.

Messih isn't a divine name. It simply means \"anointed\" or \"chosen\" in Hebrew. Rabbinical leaders (head priests), the King of Israel also had this title.\r\n\r\nI know that and the Jews have been waiting for a leader with that title for a long time. In fact modern Jews who don't believe in Jesus are still waiting for one.\r\n\r\n> The Jesus mentions consistently through the entire Bible being \"son of the father\". And representing the will of the \"father\". This is definitely (my opinion) the Jesus that you're going to want to focus on, and probably the one that did miracles of God like healing the blind.\r\n\r\nAnd also messiah. Like I said the Barabbas story is most likely a metaphor. The religious leaders chose the violent criminal over the messiah. And the former was set free by the latter's sacrifice.\r\n\r\n> The confusion is compounded by the fact that Jesus \"son of the father\" is indeed also the anointed and chosen. However, he was not the person claiming to be the king of the Jews who was being held prisoner.\r\n\r\nAncient witnesses would beg to differ. And I mean all of them, not only the canonized texts.\r\n\r\n> An illiterate orphaned Arab shepherd living a few hundred years after Jesus uttered the following, saying adamantly that it is the revelation of Elloh/Allah/Ellohim:\r\n\r\nHow do you know it was actually written by Muhammad? Or that he was really illiterate? There are plenty of pseudographia in the Bible so I am aware of how easily this can be done.\r\n\r\n> The Quran offers a beautiful story explaining how the villagers were convinced that Mary was chaste despite carrying Jesus home. It is because Jesus spoke aloud to his mother's accusors as a newborn infant as a decisive miracle from God.\r\n\r\nThe virgin birth is only mentioned once in Matthew and once in Luke, and both are completely obvious later additions to the text.
