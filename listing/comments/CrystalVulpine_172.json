European \"continental conservative\" (see Ancien R\u00e9gime) clerics thought they detected signs of modernism or classical liberalism of the sort the Pope had condemned in the Syllabus of Errors in 1864. They feared that these doctrines were held by and taught by many members of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States in the 1890s. Catholic leaders in the U.S., however, denied that they held these views.[1]\r\n\r\n> The Americanist heresy is characterized as an insistence upon individual initiative which the Vatican judged to be incompatible with what was considered to be a fundamental principle of Catholicism: obedience to authority. Moreover, the continental conservatives were anti-republicans who distrusted and disliked the democratic ideas that were dominant in America.[2]\r\n\r\n> Pope Leo XIII wrote against these ideas in his encyclical Testem benevolentiae nostrae to Cardinal James Gibbons. In 1898, Leo XIII lamented an America where church and state are \"dissevered and divorced\" and wrote of his preference for a closer relationship between the Catholic Church and the State along European lines.[3]\r\n\r\n> The long-term result was that the Irish Catholics who largely controlled the Catholic Church in the United States increasingly demonstrated their total loyalty to the Pope, and traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges were suppressed.

European \"continental conservative\" (see Ancien R\u00e9gime) clerics thought they detected signs of modernism or classical liberalism of the sort the Pope had condemned in the Syllabus of Errors in 1864. They feared that these doctrines were held by and taught by many members of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States in the 1890s. Catholic leaders in the U.S., however, denied that they held these views.[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Americanist heresy is characterized as an insistence upon individual initiative which the Vatican judged to be incompatible with what was considered to be a fundamental principle of Catholicism: obedience to authority. Moreover, the continental conservatives were anti-republicans who distrusted and disliked the democratic ideas that were dominant in America.[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pope Leo XIII wrote against these ideas in his encyclical Testem benevolentiae nostrae to Cardinal James Gibbons.
