Hence, if the Vatican 2 \"popes\" are popes, then it would seem almost absolute that Catholics must accept 3 of the Vatican 2 era \"popes\" are saints. If there is doubt or it is certain that such men are not saints, then it would seem to logically imply that the \"pope\" who canonized them is a \"doubtful pope\" or no pope.\r\n\r\nMany problems have been brought up with the personal lives of these alleged \"saints\" that would make us at least doubt that they ought to have been canonized (not that they couldn't be saints, but it would seem doubtful that they ought to be publicly held up as examples of \"heroic faith\"). John XXIII was officially suspected of modernism by the Holy See; Paul VI controversially introduced the \"New Mass\" in 1969; John Paul II participated in the scandalous ecumenical 1986 Assisi meeting. Thus it would seem possible for them to have saved their souls, but doubt is introduced that they ought to be canonized.\r\n\r\nIn the process of canonizing a saint, traditionally the \"Devil's Advocate\" would argue for why they ought not be a saint. Yet, \"Pope\" John Paul II [\"reduced the power and changed the role of the office in 1983.\"](https://infogalactic.com/info/Devil%27s_advocate) Therefore, it would seem that by doing this, it would be more likely for people to be \"canonized\" who are not saints, or it would increase the doubt about such canonizations being valid.\r\n\r\n[One SSPX writer noted the contradiction of John Paul II being \"canonized\":](https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/dilemma-canonizing-pope-john-paul-ii-3298)\r\n\r\n> If John Paul II is truly a saint, the Catholic faithful must recognize that after the final resurrection, God will be satisfied with the Moslems and they will be satisfied with Him[5]. They must then condemn the example of the Capuchin Joseph of Leonessa (1556-1612) who worked without counting the cost in Constantinople among Christians reduced to slavery by the followers of Islam. His zeal caused him to be dragged before the sultan for insulting the Moslem religion and he spent three days hung from a set of gallows by a chain attached to hooks in one hand and one foot. Faithful Catholics should also deplore the example of St. Peter Mavimenus, who died in 715 after being tortured for three days for having insulted Mohammed and Islam.\r\n\r\nJohn Paul II on this topic, stated:\r\n\r\n> I believe that we, Christians and Moslems, we must recognize with joy the religious values that we have in common and give thanks to God. (\u2026) We believe that God will be a merciful judge at the end of time and we hope that after the resurrection He will satisfied with us, and that we will be satisfied with Him.\" John Paul II, translated from the French version of his Address on the occasion of meeting young people at the stadium of Casablanca, August 18, 1985, DC 1903, p. 945. \r\n\r\nHence, these contradictions suggest there is doubt that John Paul II should have been canonized, and therefore there is doubt that \"pope\" Francis (who \"canonized\" him) is a true Catholic pope. \r\n\r\nThis is one topic that suggests sedevacantism is true.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this problem of modern \"canonizations\"?", "body_html": "<p>In recent years, the Vatican 2 \"popes\" John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul II have all been canonized or made in to \"saints\".</p>\n<p>In context, in the last 500 years, of popes only Pope Pius V and Pope Pius X were made saints.</p>\n<p>It sounds like they are trying to make Vatican 2 seem more legitimate, as if even to say that saints had called it in to session.</p>\n<p>Canonizations are considered to be next to infallible - not absolutely infallible. Hence, if the Vatican 2 \"popes\" are popes, then it would seem almost absolute that Catholics must accept 3 of the Vatican 2 era \"popes\" are saints. If there is doubt or it is certain that such men are not saints, then it would seem to logically imply that the \"pope\" who canonized them is a \"doubtful pope\" or no pope.</p>\n<p>Many problems have been brought up with the personal lives of these alleged \"saints\" that would make us at least doubt that they ought to have been canonized (not that they couldn't be saints, but it would seem doubtful that they ought to be publicly held up as examples of \"heroic faith\"). John XXIII was officially suspected of modernism by the Holy See; Paul VI controversially introduced the \"New Mass\" in 1969; John Paul II participated in the scandalous ecumenical 1986 Assisi meeting. Thus it would seem possible for them to have saved their souls, but doubt is introduced that they ought to be canonized.</p>\n<p>In the process of canonizing a saint, traditionally the \"Devil's Advocate\" would argue for why they ought not be a saint. Yet, \"Pope\" John Paul II <a href=\"https://infogalactic.com/info/Devil%27s_advocate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"reduced the power and changed the role of the office in 1983.\"</a> Therefore, it would seem that by doing this, it would be more likely for people to be \"canonized\" who are not saints, or it would increase the doubt about such canonizations being valid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/dilemma-canonizing-pope-john-paul-ii-3298\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One SSPX writer noted the contradiction of John Paul II being \"canonized\":</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If John Paul II is truly a saint, the Catholic faithful must recognize that after the final resurrection, God will be satisfied with the Moslems and they will be satisfied with Him[5]. They must then condemn the example of the Capuchin Joseph of Leonessa (1556-1612) who worked without counting the cost in Constantinople among Christians reduced to slavery by the followers of Islam. His zeal caused him to be dragged before the sultan for insulting the Moslem religion and he spent three days hung from a set of gallows by a chain attached to hooks in one hand and one foot. Faithful Catholics should also deplore the example of St. Peter Mavimenus, who died in 715 after being tortured for three days for having insulted Mohammed and Islam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>John Paul II on this topic, stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that we, Christians and Moslems, we must recognize with joy the religious values that we have in common and give thanks to God. (\u2026) We believe that God will be a merciful judge at the end of time and we hope that after the resurrection He will satisfied with us, and that we will be satisfied with Him.\" John Paul II, translated from the French version of his Address on the occasion of meeting young people at the stadium of Casablanca, August 18, 1985, DC 1903, p. 945.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, these contradictions suggest there is doubt that John Paul II should have been canonized, and therefore there is doubt that \"pope\" Francis (who \"canonized\" him) is a true Catholic pope.</p>\n<p>This is one topic that suggests sedevacantism is true.</p>\n<p>What do you think about this problem of modern \"canonizations\"?</p>\n", "comment_count": 8, "created_utc": 1625851031, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_cki3", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "cki3", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cki3/doubts-about-modern-catholic-saints", "score": 3, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Doubts About Modern \"Catholic Saints\"", "upvotes": 3, "url": ""}, "post_id": "cki3", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
