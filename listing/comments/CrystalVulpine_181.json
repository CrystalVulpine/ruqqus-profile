We're left with 2 supposed references by Paul in his actual letters, which are also not God's words. One is almost certainly incorrect, the other (Romans 1) is still uncertain, was probably added later, *and* it's part of a larger passage which is likely Paul quoting someone else judging by the way chapter 2 starts. The others are 1 Timothy, which is also very unlikely to be correct, and also not actually written by Paul. The last supposed one is Jude, which is also not God's own words; and it says \"different flesh\" not \"homo\", because if you recall the Sodomites were trying to rape the angels. The whole Jude passage is about angels too.\r\n\r\n> In the end, the context makes it most clear. A convoluted interpretation which claims gay buttsex is OK as long as you don't do it lying down in a woman's bed (in which case, it's abominable and punishable by death) doesn't really make much sense... especially when you consider all the other verses which also allude to the sinful nature of homosexuality.\r\n\r\nIt was more likely a scribal error because the sentence is actually nonsensical. If it was written as it stands, it was probably something to do with menstruation laws, or even doing it in the bed of a \"burnt offering\" which is the same word as \"woman\", and sexual acts were a common way of worshipping pagan gods in ancient times. As for the death penalty, that was unlikely actually prescribed; it's pretty obvious that Leviticus 18 was written first and that Leviticus 20 copies it, adding the legal penalties which largely go against God's nature. And even Leviticus 18 has been modified.\r\n\r\n> When I was younger, I also believed that a loving God wouldn't mind who we had sex with, but I grew out of that phase. Now I understand that our father's rules may seem mean and unfair, but we each are guilty of breaking them, (myself worse than many others) and, the main thrust of grace is to repent of our sins, not proudly declare we did nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nYou had genuine insight when you were younger, but \"grew out of it\" because your social conditioning did its job, and your brain developed further. The human brain is tribalistic and attracted to mean leaders, because it creates a strong collectivist culture and you feel safe and protected by them. It's similar to how a lot of women want a mean boyfriend, because he looks more capable. But Jesus repeatedly denounces both bad laws and made-up laws.\r\n\r\n> The obvious and traditional explanation for why these extra words were necessary is that the verb \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 literally means \u201clying down\u201d, and its use for sex is metaphoric or euphemistic. Under that explanation, those extra words are to clarify that we are talking about sex here, not about lying down.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 is not used to describe sex. As a verb it always means lie. As a noun, it almost always means bed. So here, literally, \"lie beds\".\r\n\r\n> The word \u201c\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d1\u201d is used in other places in the Bible for a bed, but in other places it is used for the act of lying down or even as a euphemism for being sick. So the interpretation that those two words mean \u201cas you would a woman\u201d is not unfounded.\r\n\r\nSo they're just going to say it *isn't* used for sex anywhere else and that's somehow evidence that's what it means. \"Lie lyings of a woman\" doesn't make sense either.\r\n\r\n> So these two interpretations are equally valid and supported by the text:\r\n> \r\n> Don\u2019t f--k a man Don\u2019t f--k a man as you would a woman OTOH \u201cDon\u2019t f--k a man on a woman\u2019s bed\u201d just doesn\u2019t make enough sense to be considered valid.\"\r\n\r\nThe first one is not valid because it is not in the text. It is, at best, a guess. And based on what we know about before the Romans took over Christianity, that guess is probably wrong.", "body_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>There are 5 other references to homosexuality in the Bible, both old and new testament, all implying it is sinful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sodom &amp; Gomorrah doesn't even comment about it, nor does Ham's story, nor are either of these God's words.

As for the death penalty, that was unlikely actually prescribed; it's pretty obvious that Leviticus 18 was written first and that Leviticus 20 copies it, adding the legal penalties which largely go against God's nature. And even Leviticus 18 has been modified.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I was younger, I also believed that a loving God wouldn't mind who we had sex with, but I grew out of that phase. Now I understand that our father's rules may seem mean and unfair, but we each are guilty of breaking them, (myself worse than many others) and, the main thrust of grace is to repent of our sins, not proudly declare we did nothing wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You had genuine insight when you were younger, but \"grew out of it\" because your social conditioning did its job, and your brain developed further. The human brain is tribalistic and attracted to mean leaders, because it creates a strong collectivist culture and you feel safe and protected by them. It's similar to how a lot of women want a mean boyfriend, because he looks more capable. But Jesus repeatedly denounces both bad laws and made-up laws.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The obvious and traditional explanation for why these extra words were necessary is that the verb \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 literally means \u201clying down\u201d, and its use for sex is metaphoric or euphemistic. Under that explanation, those extra words are to clarify that we are talking about sex here, not about lying down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is incorrect. \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 is not used to describe sex. As a verb it always means lie. As a noun, it almost always means bed. So here, literally, \"lie beds\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The word \u201c\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d1\u201d is used in other places in the Bible for a bed, but in other places it is used for the act of lying down or even as a euphemism for being sick. So the interpretation that those two words mean \u201cas you would a woman\u201d is not unfounded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So they're just going to say it <em>isn't</em> used for sex anywhere else and that's somehow evidence that's what it means. \"Lie lyings of a woman\" doesn't make sense either.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So these two interpretations are equally valid and supported by the text:</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t f--k a man Don\u2019t f--k a man as you would a woman OTOH \u201cDon\u2019t f--k a man on a woman\u2019s bed\u201d just doesn\u2019t make enough sense to be considered valid.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first one is not valid because it is not in the text. It is, at best, a guess. And based on what we know about before the Romans took over Christianity, that guess is probably wrong.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1626089531, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_12otb", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#7B9AE4", "created_utc": 1582833064, "description": "Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?
