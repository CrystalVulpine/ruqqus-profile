And yet Jesus's group was working in the field on the Sabbath. And he said, \"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction. The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time. David did not follow the tradition either, because it was wrong. But you will find it right there in the Torah. The only logical conclusion is that it has been tampered with. When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.

Not once does he warn against animal sacrifice simply being done.\n\nJeremiah 7:22\nFor in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them: \u2018Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.\u2019 But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day. Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.\n\nThis is entirely correct. If don\u2019t reject the timeline of Exodus, he did not speak to their fathers about the 10 commandments, nor about sacrifice. \n\nOn the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain, while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, \u201cThus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.\u201d\nSo Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered together and said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.\u201d\nWhen Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.\n\nAfter these days, God gave the 10 Commandments, and ceremonial sacrifice to atone to one\u2019s failure at keeping them. Evidently, there is no contradiction.\n\nIsaiah 1:\nHear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;\nfor the LORD has spoken:\n\u201cChildren have I reared and brought up,\nbut they have rebelled against me.\nThe ox knows its owner,\nand the donkey its master\u2019s crib,\nbut Israel does not know,\nmy people do not understand.\u201d\nAh, sinful nation,\na people laden with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\nchildren who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken the LORD,\nthey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nthey are utterly estranged.\nWhy will you still be struck down?\nWhy will you continue to rebel?\nThe whole head is sick,\nand the whole heart faint.\nFrom the sole of the foot even to the head,\nthere is no soundness in it,\nbut bruises and sores\nand raw wounds;\nthey are not pressed out or bound up\nor softened with oil.\nYour country lies desolate;\nyour cities are burned with fire;\nin your very presence\nforeigners devour your land;\nit is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.\nAnd the daughter of Zion is left\nlike a booth in a vineyard,\nlike a lodge in a cucumber field,\nlike a besieged city.\nIf the LORD of hosts\nhad not left us a few survivors,\nwe should have been like Sodom,\nand become like Gomorrah.\nHear the word of the LORD,\nyou rulers of Sodom!\nGive ear to the teaching of our God,\nyou people of Gomorrah!\n\u201cWhat to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\nsays the LORD;\nI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nand the fat of well-fed beasts;\nI do not delight in the blood of bulls,\nor of lambs, or of goats.\n\u201cWhen you come to appear before me,\nwho has required of you\nthis trampling of my courts?\nBring no more vain offerings;\nincense is an abomination to me.\nNew moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations\u2014\nI cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.\nYour new moons and your appointed feasts\nmy soul hates;\nthey have become a burden to me;\nI am weary of bearing them.\nWhen you spread out your hands,\nI will hide my eyes from you;\neven though you make many prayers,\nI will not listen;\nyour hands are full of blood.\nWash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\nremove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\nlearn to do good;\nseek justice,\ncorrect oppression;\nbring justice to the fatherless,\nplead the widow\u2019s cause.\n\nGod seems to rebuke sacrifice, the sabbath\u2026 and prayer. Naturally, it would do us well to look at the context, and it\u2019s extremely obvious that God is not condemning the praise itself, but the empty nature of the prayers. This is why God swiftly lists the reasons for the condemnation, a lack of justice and an increase in oppression, all while giving sacrifice as a mere ritual.\n\nMicah 6:\nHear what the LORD says:\nArise, plead your case before the mountains,\nand let the hills hear your voice.\nHear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD,\nand you enduring foundations of the earth,\nfor the LORD has an indictment against his people,\nand he will contend with Israel.\n\u201cO my people, what have I done to you?\nHow have I wearied you? Answer me!\nFor I brought you up from the land of Egypt\nand redeemed you from the house of slavery,\nand I sent before you Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam.\nO my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\nand what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\nthat you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.\u201d\n\u201cWith what shall I come before the LORD,\nand bow myself before God on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\nwith calves a year old?\nWill the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,\nwith ten thousands of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\nthe fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\u201d\nHe has told you, O man, what is good;\nand what does the LORD require of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\nand to walk humbly with your God?\n\nHere, the people in question lose the entire idea of sacrifice, and think its value must be equal to God\u2019s approval. However, God\u2019s approval is truly based on one\u2019s willingness to follow his commands, and sacrifice without attempted obedience, yet again, becomes an empty ritual.\n\nAs a close example to ceremonial values:\n\u201cJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.\n\nCalling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \u201cTruly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything\u2014all she had to live on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosea 6:4-6\nWhat shall I do with you, O Ephraim?\nWhat shall I do with you, O Judah?\nYour love is like a morning cloud,\nlike the dew that goes early away.\nTherefore I have hewn them by the prophets;\nI have slain them by the words of my mouth,\nand my judgment goes forth as the light.\nFor I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.\n\nYet again, we see an instance of a people ignoring God\u2019s commands, while hoping that their \u201cvalue\u201d of a sacrifice will redeem their empty faith. They replace steadfast love with one \u201clike a morning cloud,\u201d and, following the specific trend of God\u2019s condemnation of vain repetitions in sacrifice, believe it can save them.\n\nWe also have numerous verses of God commanding sacrifice. Of course, even after all the positive evidence towards Jeremiah 8:8\u2019s correct interpretation, and positive evidence against it proving untrue, we can simply avoid it by assuming that your interpretation of Jeremiah 8:8 is true and all verses not supporting your view of animal sacrifice are forgeries. It would be a roundabout way of circular reasoning, but without any other positive evidence there\u2019s not much more to do.\n\nWhere does Jesus disobey the Old Testament?\n\nWhat is your evidence for Ezra being responsible for an unnecessary redaction of the Old Testament?\n\nYes, Prophet Daniel referenced the Law given by Moses. We only see this Law referred to in an authoritative manner and no statements of the Law's untrustworthiness. \n\n\"However given that it literally contradicts the very sermon it's part of on nearly every point, let alone all the other times Jesus denounces the supposed law\"\nHow so?\n\n\"and isn't attested anywhere else except a one-liner in Luke that seems edited in and is in an entirely different spot\"\nInformation only attested in one gospel is hardly evidence of a forgery. There could be a debate if the information contradicts information in other gospels, but this isn't the case. Also, I'm not seeing anything about it in Luke.\n\nUnless we find an OT law about picking and eating grain on the Sabbath, this is Jesus calling the Teachers out on condemning due to manmade traditions(Mark 7:1-9). To get the point across, he acknowledges that David, a man they held in high regard, did not follow their tradition. Along with this, we see many references Jesus gave to the OT, though he does not once put it under the level of the authoritative Word of God.", "body_html": "<p>In every instance of God condemning animal sacrifice, without exception, his people are ignoring God\u2019s commands and utilizing sacrifice as a mere ceremonial, ritual obedience.
