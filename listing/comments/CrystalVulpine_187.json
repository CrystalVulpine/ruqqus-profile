And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cThe man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\u201d And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses.\u201d\n\nThe death penalty for violating the sabbath was originally set in Exodus 31:14,\n\u201cYou shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d\n\nGranted, this could be what led the Pharisees into condemning picking up any item on the sabbath. However, the command for the Sabbath was not to work, and we can logically assume:\n\n1. The man was not gathering sticks for no reason.\n2. The man was not gathering sticks to prepare an offering, which is permitted in Numbers 28:9, and confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 12, and would ironically be considered to \u201cprofane\u201d the sabbath by the Pharisees(\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?\u201d)\n\nThe most rational conclusion would be that this man was gathering sticks in a work effort involving sticks, thereby deserving of his penalty. However, \u201cwork\u201d does not mean getting out of bed in the morning, nor does it mean lifting up food to eat, such as Jesus were.\n\n> \"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction. \n\nNo? It\u2019s a plainly true statement. Jesus acknowledges that Man was created, then the Sabbath was created as a day to cease working, in remembrance of God ceasing the creation of the universe on the seventh day. This is contradictory to the Pharisees\u2019 idea that Man cannot be healed on the Sabbath, despite it not being work. It\u2019s only a \u201cmajor contradiction\u201d if you distort the idea of the Sabbath.\n\n> The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time. \nNo. We see, by the Matthew 12 example, that they followed a misinterpretation of the sabbath.\n\n> When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.\n\nWhen you try to reconcile all contradictory ideas, it would end up with things like Marcionism. If we instead review each idea and it\u2019s individual merit, while accepting that, upon review, most interpretations simply don\u2019t hold water, such as God condemning animal sacrifice, we do not end up with things like Marcionism. If we were to have two historical accounts,\nJohn entered the code 3815 to the safe at 11:00 pm. It opened. He closed it.\nJohn entered the code 2815 to the safe at 11:03 pm.

The first account is fake, and between the first and second account are different Johns. Also, it was the wrong code,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.\nIf I were to say, \u201cAlright, the safe can\u2019t be racist and nonexistant at the same time, the first historical account is fake,\u201d I could be taken even less seriously. \nWith the information we have, we can say \u201cIt was the wrong code,\u201d is the interpretation we should follow.\n\n> The typical excuse for doing this is called dispensationalism, where Jesus apparently \"fulfilled the law, well at least the parts we don't like, we'll still keep the ones we like to judge others for\" which there is no evidence of whatsoever.\n\n\u201cNo evidence whatsoever\u201d is flippantly incorrect, but you can disprove the evidence, such as attempted with sacrifice prior.\n\n> If it were true then why does Jesus rebuke people for not following the supposed \"new way\" pre-Atonement?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying here. What \u201cnew way?\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe whole format of the sermon (and basically his entire ministry) for one: \"You have heard it said...but I say to you do not do that, but do this instead\". Almost every time he says that he's quoting an Old Testament law and condemning it.\u201d\n\nThe quotes in question will be Matthew 5:21, 27, 31, 33, 38, and 43.\n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201d\n\nWe can reason that Jesus does not wish to abolish the command \u201cYou shall not murder,\u201d as either side of the argument contains to records of God ruling murder acceptable, nor does there exist record of God opposed to judgment for murder. Jesus does not reject that God commanded against murder, but it is in His power to evolve the command. Though it was not yet revealed in the Old Testament due to the hard hearts of man, Jesus is enforcing the command against murder to it\u2019s roots, malice towards one\u2019s brother. In mentioning the established command, he demonstrates the base for his enforcement on the spiritual grounds of non-love towards a fellow Man. Though the OT command allowed some flexibility in this regard, Jesus stiffened the command, as it would now be efficient in causing more good in the world as those with softer hearts can now understand. \n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\u201d\n\nJesus again doesn\u2019t disagree with the command against adultery, but it allows that outside the physical. The complete commandment against adultery, a command against lust outside the physical, at the time of the OT would be a failure of efficiency and ultimately reject the Old and New Testament concept of God using others\u2019 choices of evil to establish good. Though it could be done with \u201cgood intentions\u201d, God knows better than to declare a command that would only cause greater evil with no regard to the good of the future.\n\n\u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u201d\n\nThough the original command\u2019s allowance of divorce on the basis of indecency seems to allow flexibility, to the reason defined prior, Jesus again builds upon the command, evolving indecency to sexual immorality. \n\n\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.\u201d\n\nWe can copy/paste the prior interpretations here, though it would be worth noting that Jesus was, most likely, speaking in hyperbole. Rather than rebuking all solemn oaths and vows, Jesus would\u2019ve been rebuking the misuse of God in a non-reverent nature, such as \u201cI swear to God!\u201d\n\nYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n\nThough the OT never said to hate your enemy, there were likely many at this time who took \u201cneighbor\u201d to mean ally, therefore allowing one to hate one\u2019s enemy. Jesus concludes this section of the Sermon by giving a command to love one\u2019s enemies.\n\n> And the most fundamental problem is that there is ZERO evidence of God ever sanctioning \"The Bible\". He did not drop it out of the sky one day, and he did not ever say it was protected from error. It was put together by humans, copied over the millenia by humans, and made into a replacement for the spirit by humans. \n\nGod dropping The Bible from the sky obviously isn\u2019t the only way to examine it\u2019s authenticity, and repeating \"no evidence\" doesn't change that. One way to examine authenticity would be to see what Jesus Himself said about the OT, which was put together by humans, and examine the NT.\n\n(1/2)", "body_html": "<p>\u201cWhile the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
