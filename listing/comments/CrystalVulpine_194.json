We see hypergamy run amok now in society, as women are no longer shamed by religion and cultural values to not sleep around.  However, now it's \"girl power\" for a woman to go behind her husband's back and shop for a lover or a replacement husband.  That behavior would have been despised in previous decades.  People were right back then and are wrong now.  That behavior is disgusting.  One used to work to override hypergamy with good values, values that said you take a vow to spend your life with one person and be loyal to that one person through thick and thin.

No one dreamed up an evil scheme to make life tough for women.  It's just biology.  Yet, men get blamed for it.  That makes as much sense as protesting against the rings of Saturn.  Saturn has rings.  If that upsets you, you're out of luck.  It's just how it is and no one can change it.  The women screaming that it's tougher to date in their 30s and 40s, might as well form a protest group to protest Saturns rings.  They could protest gravity as well.
