People were right back then and are wrong now.  That behavior is disgusting.  One used to work to override hypergamy with good values, values that said you take a vow to spend your life with one person and be loyal to that one person through thick and thin.

We were a more moral society when we despised adultery.  \r\n\r\nWe MGTOW are honest that hypergamy exists.  We acknowledge men's bad instincts too.  Men do have violent instincts.  However, we're expected to use our intellects to keep those instincts in check.  That's demanded of a man, but not of a woman.  Women are being indulged with their base instincts.  We're only telling the truth when we say that women have instincts to trade up to a higher value mate.  Being honest somehow makes us the bad guy.  It's because the lunatic feminist movement is doing all it can to hide women's instincts.  They force a dogma down people's throats, exactly like the Church forced the geocentric dogma down its followers throats.  \r\n\r\nDenying the existence of the hypergamous instinct makes as much sense as denying that woman's sexual marketplace value declines over time.  She's most desirable in her late teens and early to mid twenties.  That's just how human instinct and biology work.  No one set it up that way.  It came about via millions of years of evolution.  No one dreamed up an evil scheme to make life tough for women.  It's just biology.  Yet, men get blamed for it.  That makes as much sense as protesting against the rings of Saturn.  Saturn has rings.  If that upsets you, you're out of luck.  It's just how it is and no one can change it.  The women screaming that it's tougher to date in their 30s and 40s, might as well form a protest group to protest Saturns rings.  They could protest gravity as well.

You would think that a willingness to accept reality would be standard and no big deal, but think again.  Reality has always been a threat to some people.  It was a threat when people first figured out that the Earth was not the center of the universe.  That notion went against the church's teachings of the time, and they threw a fit over it.</p>\n<p>We've all seen evidence of hypergamy all our lives.  I remember back in high school, it used to annoy me that girls would go for \"an older guy,\" often college or professional men in their early 20s, sometimes even older.  It annoyed the crap out of me, but it was just their natural hypergamy instincts talking.  They were attracted to men who already had some resources.  We see hypergamy run amok now in society, as women are no longer shamed by religion and cultural values to not sleep around.  However, now it's \"girl power\" for a woman to go behind her husband's back and shop for a lover or a replacement husband.  That behavior would have been despised in previous decades.  People were right back then and are wrong now.  That behavior is disgusting.
