Of course I saw it in the \"suggested videos\" sidebar. The majority of the stuff was stupid mods, and it seemed like a decent channel, although the 1M+ subscribers surprised me a little. But then I wondered why I hadn't seen them before, so I checked their older videos and...wait, that's not right, they only had 34 total, the first one being...*this December*?!\r\n\r\nI first assumed they just removed their older videos for some reason, so I did a bit more digging and found his [twitter account](https://twitter.com/fundylive). And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch was created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nAnd just now I found two more of these YouTubers that follow the exact same pattern as Fundy!\r\n\r\n[GeorgeNotFound](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeorgeNotFound/channels)\r\n\r\n[Dream](https://www.youtube.com/Dreamm)\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see when I was going to post this on +Minecraft is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

Of course I saw it in the \"suggested videos\" sidebar. The majority of the stuff was stupid mods, and it seemed like a decent channel, although the 1M+ subscribers surprised me a little.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video.

He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe....

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit\u2019s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here\u2019s a prediction about what\u2019s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to \u201ccontrol the narrative\u201d and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can\u2019t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it\u2019s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit\u2019s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it\u2019s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit\u2019s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don\u2019t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can\u2019t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit\u2019s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I\u2019ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it\u2019s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren\u2019t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren\u2019t explicitly banned yet but it\u2019s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit\u2019s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it\u2019s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it\u2019s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being \u201cchuds\u201d (unless one is a socialist of course, then they\u2019ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn\u2019t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?", "body_html": "<p>This is only prediction and I\u2019ll likely be wildly off.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit\u2019s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here\u2019s a prediction about what\u2019s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to \u201ccontrol the narrative\u201d and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can\u2019t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it\u2019s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit\u2019s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it\u2019s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit\u2019s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don\u2019t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can\u2019t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit\u2019s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I\u2019ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it\u2019s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren\u2019t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren\u2019t explicitly banned yet but it\u2019s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit\u2019s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it\u2019s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it\u2019s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being \u201cchuds\u201d (unless one is a socialist of course, then they\u2019ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn\u2019t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?", "body_html": "<p>This is only prediction and I\u2019ll likely be wildly off.

The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren\u2019t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren\u2019t explicitly banned yet but it\u2019s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit\u2019s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it\u2019s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it\u2019s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being \u201cchuds\u201d (unless one is a socialist of course, then they\u2019ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn\u2019t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?", "body_html": "<p>This is only prediction and I\u2019ll likely be wildly off. I\u2019m also gonna update my list I originally made in June for the Ban Wave News to put on more subs. I would also like it if someone crossposted this to T_C.</p>\n<p>This is the inspiration here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeclineIntoCensorship/comments/fvhjys/past_present_and_future_of_reddits_death/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/DeclineIntoCensorship/comments/fvhjys/past_present_and_future_of_reddits_death/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>So as you all are likely aware, there\u2019s increasing animosity on Reddit about what\u2019s been happening lately. With the new hate speech policy, Reddit\u2019s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here\u2019s a prediction about what\u2019s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.</p>\n<p>Late July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.</p>\n<p>August 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to \u201ccontrol the narrative\u201d and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can\u2019t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.</p>\n<p>August 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it\u2019s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit\u2019s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it\u2019s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.</p>\n<p>September 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.</p>\n<p>Late September 2020: In honor of Reddit\u2019s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.</p>\n<p>Early October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don\u2019t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.</p>\n<p>Mid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can\u2019t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.</p>\n<p>October 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit\u2019s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.</p>\n<p>November 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I\u2019ll go based off of the middle.</p>\n<p>November/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.</p>\n<p>December 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.</p>\n<p>January-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it\u2019s existence becomes know among most Redditors.

Of course I saw it in the \"suggested videos\" sidebar. The majority of the stuff was stupid mods, and it seemed like a decent channel, although the 1M+ subscribers surprised me a little. But then I wondered why I hadn't seen them before, so I checked their older videos and...wait, that's not right, they only had 34 total, the first one being...*this December*?!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I found more of these YouTubers that follow the exact same pattern as Fundy!\r\n\r\n[GeorgeNotFound](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeorgeNotFound/channels)\r\n\r\n[Dream](https://www.youtube.com/Dreamm)\r\n\r\nEND UPDATE\r\n\r\nI first assumed they just removed their older videos for some reason, so I did a bit more digging and found his [twitter account](https://twitter.com/fundylive). And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a <em>beginner</em>, which didn't sit right with me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million views on his first few videos in January</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50k subs in January</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">100k in March</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">200k in April</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">270k a few weeks later</a></p>\n<p>After that it's literally about 100k per week</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">400k a month later</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">700k 2 weeks later</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million a few weeks later</a></p>\n<p>The other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he <em>did</em> have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Proof of older videos that were removed</a></p>\n<p>For reference, here's the statistics of his <em>super legitimate</em> growth over the past few months: <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw</a></p>\n<p>This seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.</p>\n<p>I got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"living in a van\" channel</a>.</p>\n<p>This would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.</p>\n<p>Here's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is an example: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?</p>\n<p>Imo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.</p>\n<p>(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)</p>\n", "comment_count": 12, "created_utc": 1595440909, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1595442813, "fullname": "t2_1gbm", "guild_id": "1u", "guild_name": "Minecraft", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1gbm", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Minecraft/post/1gbm/do-you-think-the-new-mc", "score": 20, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Do you think the new MC YouTuber Fundy is just an industry plant?", "upvotes": 21, "url": ""}, "post_id": "1gbm", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}

Of course I saw it in the \"suggested videos\" sidebar. The majority of the stuff was stupid mods, and it seemed like a decent channel, although the 1M+ subscribers surprised me a little. But then I wondered why I hadn't seen them before, so I checked their older videos and...wait, that's not right, they only had 34 total, the first one being...*this December*?!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I found more of these YouTubers that follow the exact same pattern as Fundy!\r\n\r\n[GeorgeNotFound](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeorgeNotFound/channels)\r\n\r\n[Dream](https://www.youtube.com/Dreamm)\r\n\r\nEND UPDATE\r\n\r\nI first assumed they just removed their older videos for some reason, so I did a bit more digging and found his [twitter account](https://twitter.com/fundylive). And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

But then I wondered why I hadn't seen them before, so I checked their older videos and...wait, that's not right, they only had 34 total, the first one being...<em>this December</em>?!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I found more of these YouTubers that follow the exact same pattern as Fundy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/GeorgeNotFound/channels\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GeorgeNotFound</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/Dreamm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dream</a></p>\n<p>END UPDATE</p>\n<p>I first assumed they just removed their older videos for some reason, so I did a bit more digging and found his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fundylive\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twitter account</a>. And behold, the video from this December really <em>was</em> the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner <em>and</em> they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a <em>beginner</em>, which didn't sit right with me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million views on his first few videos in January</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50k subs in January</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">100k in March</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">200k in April</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">270k a few weeks later</a></p>\n<p>After that it's literally about 100k per week</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">400k a month later</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">700k 2 weeks later</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million a few weeks later</a></p>\n<p>The other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he <em>did</em> have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Proof of older videos that were removed</a></p>\n<p>For reference, here's the statistics of his <em>super legitimate</em> growth over the past few months: <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw</a></p>\n<p>This seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.</p>\n<p>I got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"living in a van\" channel</a>.</p>\n<p>This would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.</p>\n<p>Here's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is an example: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?</p>\n<p>Imo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.</p>\n<p>(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)</p>\n", "comment_count": 12, "created_utc": 1595440909, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1595442813, "fullname": "t2_1gbm", "guild_id": "1u", "guild_name": "Minecraft", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1gbm", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Minecraft/post/1gbm/do-you-think-the-new-mc", "score": 19, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Do you think the new MC YouTuber Fundy is just an industry plant?", "upvotes": 21, "url": ""}, "post_id": "1gbm", "score": 1, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
