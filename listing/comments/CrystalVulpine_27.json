This service is run by SalesForce, which has been known to use its terms and conditions to restrict user freedom. [For example, it does not allow users of its services to sell firearms of any sort.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/30/salesforce-bans-some-gun-sellers-from-using-its-software.html)\r\n\r\nSince SalesForce has been known to do such things, it could try to deplatform Ruqqus in the future. Fortune 500 companies like Salesforce aren't exactly known for their amiability towards the sort of free speech absolutism that Ruqqus stands for. Not to mention that Heroku is rather unscalable and gets expensive pretty quickly, so if Ruqqus gets big then it will be difficult to keep running.\r\n\r\nI think we could really use a contingency plan in case SalesForce tries to deplatform Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nI am a software developer by profession and I have three possible contingency plans in mind to elaborate on. Skip the rest of this paragraph to go right to them. Two if Ruqqus core devs really like Heroku-style easy deployments and one that can scale. All are easily transferrable to basically any hosting provider anywhere, and I made sure of that since big cloud providers (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud Platform/RackSpace/etc) have a known hostility to freedom. Examples being [AWS forcing Signal to decrease the accessibility of their platform around the world by using the AWS terms and conditions as a weapon](https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/), [Microsoft threatening to drop hosting for gab.ai and PayPal denying its services to gab.ai for \"hate speech\"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17671188/microsoft-gab-hate-speech-hosting-ban-deplatform), and [RackSpace denying service to some pastor for burning copies of the Quran on the anniversary of 9/11, again using terms and conditions as a weapon, specifically against freedom of speech this time.](https://www.tgdaily.com/entertainment/web-hosting-firm-boots-out-book-burning-pastor/) There are also stories of all sorts of people getting deplatformed on Youtube for their speech, which I'm sure you're all aware of.\r\n\r\nHosting providers, Heroku included, would not hesitate to screw over Ruqqus if they could save themselves some bad press.\r\n\r\nEdit 3: inserted here since it may be interesting to the dev team. Plans 1 and 2 probably cost *less* than Heroku in terms of money.\r\n\r\nPlan 1 - Heroku-style deployment without Heroku (Dokku):\r\n\r\nWe could use Dokku, a free and open source self-hosted Heroku alternative, on any server we want. Pretty small footprint memory-wise. It supports Heroku buildpacks for deployment by default, which makes stuff really easy. However, this is not too scalable as you can't multi-host and load-balance. Dokku would be very easy though until Ruqqus gets big, at which point it would no longer be scalable.\r\n\r\nPlan 2 - Heroku-style deployment without Heroku (CapRover): \r\nWe could use CapRover instead of Dokku, another free and open source self-hosted Heroku clone that is also easy to use. The great part is that you can use multiple servers, do load balancing, and it has a GUI for management if you want to use it unlike Dokku among other things. The only unfortunate part is that it doesn't support Heroku-style buildpacks.\r\n\r\nPlan 3 - OpenStack (open-source alternative to AWS/Azure/Google Cloud Platform/RackSpace):\r\n\r\nThis is the most scalable idea, but also has the most overhead and the most cost so this is definitely not what we want for now. The reason I include it is to make the core dev team aware that it exists. Think of it as a free (though hosting it has a cost) and open-source version of AWS, with compute/containers/functions/object and block storage/load balancer/identity/DNS service/clustering/alarms/databases/everything. *Most importantly, infrastructure-as-code platforms like Terraform and Chef support it so it can be automatically assembled anywhere if we had/needed the resources to host it*. It is less documented since less people use it, but documentation is sufficient enough that it is usable to an experienced generalist developer (and even moreso for a devops specialist).\r\n\r\nI am not asking for a rework of Ruqqus to be very clear, it's fine as-is for now. But I really think the Ruqqus dev team should have a backup plan to avoid being deplatformed (and get up and running again within a day-ish if it does happen). I can help with this if it is ever desired, but in the meantime I'll just do PRs on Github to help out with the current Ruqqus. Just discovered this platform yesterday though so it will be a bit before I'm useful.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Something else the Ruqqus devs may want to consider is moving from Github to a self-hosted Gitlab instance, since its CI/CD tooling is better and you can't get your codebase deplatformed (Github has done repo takedowns before)", "body_html": "<p>Edit: links added</p>\n<p>Hi Ruqqus and Ruqqus Devs,</p>\n<p>I have noticed that Ruqqus runs on Heroku.
