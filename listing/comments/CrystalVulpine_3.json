Every single person who gets invited as a mod to subreddits only gets in that position because they know somebody on the existing team, and the DefaultMods cabal controls about 95% of large and medium sized subreddits, although this is true of almost any mod team. Even when they hold moderator \"applications\" the only people who get accepted are connected to them in one way or another. Everyone else doesn't have enough experience or can't be trusted, because they've never been a mod before, because they couldn't ever become a mod since they aren't already a mod. Not once have I ever seen anyone <em>legitimately</em> begin as a moderator. They are very exclusive about who gets to be a mod, and consistently refuse to consider adding anyone outside their own circle even when they can't keep up with the mod work.
