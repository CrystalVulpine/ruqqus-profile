Keep supporting it and using it until when and if it dies like reddit and digg did.\r\n\r\nI'm only making this post in case anyone wonders why I quit participating. I think for me, I need to give things some time to cool down. Ever since the beginning, the admins haven't really gotten along with me. Why, I don't think either of us know, they just didn't. But it's led to endless back and forth fighting and rants between us and I think it's best if I quit for some time. I still enjoy the shitposting and political discussions, but the community is no fun when I can't really do anything in it because of the hot water between me and the admins. I do think they've been a bit unfair to me, at least until I started ranting about them, but I also completely overreact about every little thing they do in response. So my goal is to leave the site long enough for this to blow over. I don't want these stupid grudges to destroy this site for me or anyone else. Hopefully by the time I'm back we'll both be in a better mood. I don't know how long that will be. It could be a week, months, or even a year or two. But I will check the site occasionally to try and determine the best time to return.\r\n\r\nI won't leave forever, but it could be a while.
