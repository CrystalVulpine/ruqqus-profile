Those are great for finding long-time popular reposts, but all except the latter are terrible for discovering *new* (quality) content.

It's mostly twitter and telegram, which not everyone uses, so that's most likely why other people can't discover things as easily. I'd imagine the same goes for instagram and others as well. So I guess make an account and follow those things, but that can be very difficult because most sites require you to link your phone number and other information to your account now. Reddit and Ruqqus are probably the only popular sites left on the entire planet that don't, hell even imgur makes you do it!</p>\n", "created_utc": 1597767371, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1597767533, "fullname": "t3_7yb0", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/foxes/banner-2.png", "color": "#F39731", "created_utc": 1590785363, "description": "Anything having to do with foxes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooking for high-quality non-political Guilds?

I have to google even very basic things that even people who don't use those as their main language would know about.
