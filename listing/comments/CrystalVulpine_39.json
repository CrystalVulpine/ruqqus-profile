For others, they just make giant tangled messes.\r\n\r\nI actually am mostly a hobbyist and self taught, though that describes a lot of these devs too, and most formal education in the field is junk and everything it covers even I would already know by now. I know it helps you work better with teams, but my question is **solely about projects done by yourself**. Maybe it's different outside the US, but that's my experience. Actually now that I think of it there is a very high proportion of devs who don't live in the US compared to the rest of the site, so maybe that is the case.

I didn't say new swimmer. I said not a strong swimmer. I use this analogy for a specific reason. There are many ways that one may not be a strong swimmer. New to swimming is one. Another might be fear. My friend used to be one of the best divers I knew. One day he got into a bad accident that sent him upside down into a river and almost died. After that, he couldn't muster a doggie paddle, had to give up diving. He eventually got back into swimming way later in life, but after a lot of determination and effort. Most importantly, it was patience with himself.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be fair to compare my friend when he was starting over again to his capacity in his prime. And that's what I'm trying to get across to you. You're being impatient with yourself and trying to push yourself to a level you're not quite at yet. You're being unfair with yourself by comparing you to other people in other situations.\r\n\r\nAs for why, it's something you need to ask and be honest with yourself. \r\n\r\nAre you putting in the hours? \r\n\r\nAre you doing things that interests you so that you stick with it? \r\n\r\nIs it important to be skilled at this? \r\n\r\nI can't tell you why you're not picking up the concepts.

I didn't say new swimmer. I said not a strong swimmer. I use this analogy for a specific reason. There are many ways that one may not be a strong swimmer. New to swimming is one. Another might be fear. My friend used to be one of the best divers I knew. One day he got into a bad accident that sent him upside down into a river and almost died. After that, he couldn't muster a doggie paddle, had to give up diving. He eventually got back into swimming way later in life, but after a lot of determination and effort.
