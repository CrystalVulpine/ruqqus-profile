Even if I'm playing Minecraft or something I can never think of anything to do but build the most generic house or walk around the world aimlessly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I suck at any kind of game, both real life games and video games. This includes ones I play a lot. Most people can always beat me even the first time they play.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It doesn't matter how much practice or focus or experience I have, I'm never ever improve. So I guess the only solution is that I'll never be able to do anything at all, so I'm quitting everything I like to do because I can't even do it.</p>\n<p>I don't know where I'm going to go from here. I can't have any hobbies so Idk what to do with my time from now on. I suppose just sit around and watch tv and youtube all the time. I don't like that, but I guess I don't have a fucking choice.</p>\n<p>Is there anything I can do?</p>\n", "comment_count": 104, "created_utc": 1598394912, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_2mot", "guild_id": "1vk", "guild_name": "Talk", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2mot", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": "1", "original_guild_name": "general", "permalink": "/+Talk/post/2mot/i-think-im-quitting-everything", "score": 48, "thumb_url": null, "title": "I think I'm quitting everything", "upvotes": 50, "url": ""}, "post_id": "2mot", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
