Plenty of C++ compilers yield different results for the same code. See [here](https://is.muni.cz/th/webh9/thesis.pdf). Javascript is formally defined, and V8, the most prevalent runtime, is extremely consistent. See [here](https://daejunpark.github.io/p346-park.pdf). The ability to live up to spec is comparable, although JS interpreters are not quite as consistent.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re talking about extreeeeeeme edge cases, though. If you write a for loop in js, it acts like a for loop, just like it does in C++. You only get into compiler or runtime inconsistencies with very atypical, often extremely unexpected abuses of the language. That applies to both C++ and js. Your seeming claim that you can\u2019t rely on keywords to act as keywords in js is retarded.\r\n\r\nSecond, your claim that \u201ceverything\u201d is harder and will take \u201c10 years to do in JS\u201d is patently untrue. I\u2019ve used both plenty. I agree C++ isn\u2019t that bad, but you\u2019re painting js as insanely more complicated, which makes zero fucking sense. I was curious what you\u2019d come up with/thought you might have a credible take here (C++ has its place/is more appropriate for a lot of things, for sure), but I\u2019ve never heard anyone try to claim the syntax for js was super confusing or complicated, especially compared to C++. No one I know, including myself, finds basic js syntax harder than C++. Javascript is a c family language for fucks sake. A lot of the syntax is inherited from c. It\u2019s not like some weird different kind of thing like Haskell.\r\n\r\nWhat I suspect is going on here is you\u2019ve dealt with crappy spaghetti code JS (plenty of which exists, likely more so than in any other language; you could argue JS makes it easy to write crappy code, in part because its easy for novices to build up and you\u2019re using it in the context of browser crap), and have attributed that difficulty to the language itself.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to be clear, I\u2019m not a JS fanboy. There\u2019s plenty to complain about with JS. It has a lot of problems. But most of those relate to how it doesn\u2019t have types and can encourage designs that lead to long term maintainability issues/how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with it, and the chaotic ecosystem/crappy libraries.

Javascript is formally defined, and V8, the most prevalent runtime, is extremely consistent. See <a href=\"https://daejunpark.github.io/p346-park.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The ability to live up to spec is comparable, although JS interpreters are not quite as consistent.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re talking about extreeeeeeme edge cases, though. If you write a for loop in js, it acts like a for loop, just like it does in C++. You only get into compiler or runtime inconsistencies with very atypical, often extremely unexpected abuses of the language. That applies to both C++ and js. Your seeming claim that you can\u2019t rely on keywords to act as keywords in js is retarded.</p>\n<p>Second, your claim that \u201ceverything\u201d is harder and will take \u201c10 years to do in JS\u201d is patently untrue. I\u2019ve used both plenty. I agree C++ isn\u2019t that bad, but you\u2019re painting js as insanely more complicated, which makes zero fucking sense. I was curious what you\u2019d come up with/thought you might have a credible take here (C++ has its place/is more appropriate for a lot of things, for sure), but I\u2019ve never heard anyone try to claim the syntax for js was super confusing or complicated, especially compared to C++. No one I know, including myself, finds basic js syntax harder than C++. Javascript is a c family language for fucks sake. A lot of the syntax is inherited from c. It\u2019s not like some weird different kind of thing like Haskell.</p>\n<p>What I suspect is going on here is you\u2019ve dealt with crappy spaghetti code JS (plenty of which exists, likely more so than in any other language; you could argue JS makes it easy to write crappy code, in part because its easy for novices to build up and you\u2019re using it in the context of browser crap), and have attributed that difficulty to the language itself.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I\u2019m not a JS fanboy. There\u2019s plenty to complain about with JS. It has a lot of problems. But most of those relate to how it doesn\u2019t have types and can encourage designs that lead to long term maintainability issues/how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with it, and the chaotic ecosystem/crappy libraries. The language itself isn\u2019t the crapshoot, difficult to write simple things with, pray it works thing you\u2019re describing.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1598911565, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 1598913237, "fullname": "t3_9vl0", "guild_id": "3i", "herald_guild": null, "id": "9vl0", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 3, "parent_comment_id": ["9vgl"], "permalink": "/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9vl0", "post_id": "2u8f", "score": 5, "upvotes": 6, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["9vl0"], "permalink": "/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9vvn", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "I am not even close to a good developer, and C++ is my main language.

You\u2019re motivated to spend time on the mountain. But you seem to compare yourself to others a lot, and view competency in a language or programming skill more generally like some sort of ranked competition. The best software engineers I know just really like writing good software; they just look up one day and realize \u201coh, shit, I\u2019m really good at this thing now\u201d. This is cliche advice, but its really valuable; learn to love the journey, not the destination.</p>\n<p>Also, know that there are always going to be people that know more than you in some area. That\u2019s fine. Just be humble, figure out what your weaknesses are and what you\u2019d like to improve at a level thats actually actionable. You identified some; maybe try getting a raspberry pi and setting up raspbian/compiling stuff on that, if you\u2019re interested.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1598920144, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_9w5x", "guild_id": "3i", "herald_guild": null, "id": "9w5x", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+Programming/post/2dwr/why-do-i-suck-so-bad/9w5x", "post_id": "2dwr", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["9w5x"], "permalink": "/+Programming/post/2dwr/why-do-i-suck-so-bad/9wfy", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "I started my first programming about 8 years ago in Java.

In 1939, there was a Nazi rally in New York at Madison Square Garden. The era saw a lot of what you would consider today antisemitism, because the Jewish families robbed our country blind and sank us into the Great Depression. They worked in unison from the small businesses to the big banking oligarchs to ensure they were taken care of at the expense of the gentile populace. They undermined and attacked Christian churches both ideologically and physically. At that Rally (jump to 3:30) they suggested giving the power of Jewish controlled politicians back to the people that founded the country. At that moment a jew rushed the stage trying to attack them and disrupt his speech. They can't have that idea catching on...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there was a Nazi rally in New York at one point.
