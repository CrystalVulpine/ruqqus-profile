That's my biggest problem in life I think, I've always dealt with it, and it's killing pretty much everything I ever try to accomplish. Probably I lack the natural ability to do so, so I resort to thinking too hard about stuff and it doesn't work. It's some kind of a massive mental block that covers all different fields and I have no idea what to do about it. It wasn't always there, I think it began about a decade ago and intensified as time went on.

It kills me in programming, storytelling, art, math, science, music, humor, wording things, Minecraft, even making posts on reddit/ruqqus! It's very frustrating and has been going on for about a decade now with no end in sight. I can live with it but I'd <em>really</em> prefer a solution if there is one because I am not someone who likes to be bored and doing nothing all the time.

They act like C++ is a completely different and unrelated language to C, and that C is evil and to be avoided at all costs (There is also the flip side, C programmers who hate anything associated with C++). They end up shooting themselves in the foot wasting time creating some insane mechanism to do a task that's very simple to achieve with C-like methods, and then they get slow programs as a result. There are also those who insist on using OOP structures for <em>everything</em> no matter what, though they're usually not as bad as in some other languages (and this too has a flip side, where some people refuse to use <em>any</em> kind of OOP whatsoever).</p>\n", "created_utc": 1599402130, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_afzx", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/programming/banner-17.png", "color": "#044966", "created_utc": 1582928650, "description": "Back-end to front-end.\n\n---\nRelated guilds:\n\n+Webdev\n\n+Privacy\n\n+MachineLearning\n\n+Productivity\n\n+OpenSource", "description_html": "<p>Back-end to front-end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Related guilds:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Webdev\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Webdev/pic/profile\"/>+Webdev</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Privacy\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Privacy/pic/profile\"/>+Privacy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+MachineLearning\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+MachineLearning/pic/profile\"/>+MachineLearning</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Productivity\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Productivity/pic/profile\"/>+Productivity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+OpenSource\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+OpenSource/pic/profile\"/>+OpenSource</a></p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_3i", "id": "3i", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "Programming", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+Programming", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/programming/profile-10.png"}, "guild_id": "3i", "herald_guild": null, "id": "afzx", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent": {"author_name": "koromori", "award_count": 0, "body": "Rust, Haskell, Lisp.
