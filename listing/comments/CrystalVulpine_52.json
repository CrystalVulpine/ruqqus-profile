I\u2019m constantly adapting this myself. \r\n\r\nAll of these I consider \u201cpassive\u201d:\r\n\r\nThe first thing I check is this:\r\n\r\nhttps://wearethene.ws/\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s aggregator that pulls the notables from the breads on 8kun I was talking about before. It\u2019s currently broken this week, but I\u2019m hoping they fix it soon. \r\n\r\nWhen I want to check manually, I go the clearnet link:\r\n\r\nhttps://8kun.top/qresearch/catalog.html\r\n\r\nThe Q Research thread closest to the top is the active and most current bread. I turn off the images in the top right corner so I don\u2019t have to see NSFW/NSFL images. \r\n\r\nNext I check Disrn:\r\n\r\nhttps://disrn.com/\r\n\r\nDisrn is my current favorite news site. I learned about Disrn when the creator of the Babylon bee announced he was leaving them to start a news site. \r\n\r\nThen I check:\r\n\r\nhttps://thefederalist.com/blog/\r\n\r\nhttps://pjmedia.com/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.redstate.com/\r\n\r\nhttps://townhall.com/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/\r\n\r\nhttps://rantingly.com/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/news\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/all\r\n\r\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/news/\r\n\r\nhttps://notthebee.com/\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve found these from other posting them, being referenced by other things, or searching for them. About every few months I do a search for conservative news outlets or aggregators. \r\n\r\nThen I see what my conservative political commentators are talking about etc. Usually a wrap or further discussion of stuff that happened earlier in the week. Good for people who aren\u2019t active in seeing this news. It\u2019s fun/relatable to watch and good for sharing. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/markdice\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NextNewsNetwork\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/BenSwann\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PrisonPlanetLive\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheOfficerTatum\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kevinellerbe\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/prageruniversity\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/oann\r\n\r\nAlso White House has events everyday: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteHouse\r\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t always watch/check everything. Some days I watch/listen more and some days I don\u2019t. Depends on my mood. \r\n\r\nNow digesting that\u2019s info is another component. Dealing with fake news. Discerning truth means finding sources. Since I am aware of the general political landscape. I know when people say \u201cTrump said this\u201d, I can check the White House for videos of him at events (and probably I already watched). Which means I\u2019ll know if he said and if it\u2019s consistent with his daily character. If it\u2019s about an incident, I may have already heard about it from the anons. While I don\u2019t have Twitter, I can still search it. I will search with hashtags. Or you can use reverse image lookup for original sources. When people talk about a document, I\u2019ll go find it. Sometimes I just copy and paste quotes into search to see where else they pop up. If it\u2019s like an incident, I\u2019ll search YouTube for videos of it or Bitchute. \r\n\r\nBut as you can see I have a wholistic net that covers things for different angles and different entities connect. You absorb certain meta information by engaging with it. \r\n\r\nI used to have other methods as well. I used to be on the_donald on reddit, I used to be an active and regular member of that discord as well and people would drop info and other discords. But as I\u2019ve gotten more independent in sourcing my info, I don\u2019t need some of them. Sometimes getting cut off from sources means finding new ways to find information because you are forced to. \r\n\r\nOther days I pivot into active exploring. This where I explore the edges of what I know and further my knowledge in general or fix gaps in my information net, like finding more conservative women perspectives. This is also conspiracy related content and political, philosophical, theological theory. \r\n\r\nAnd some days I focus more on non-political content. \r\n\r\nThoughts, questions?", "body_html": "<p>So maybe it\u2019ll help if I add this concept.

I learned about Disrn when the creator of the Babylon bee announced he was leaving them to start a news site.</p>\n<p>Then I check:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://thefederalist.com/blog/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pjmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://pjmedia.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.redstate.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://townhall.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://townhall.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rantingly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://rantingly.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/news\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.justice.gov/news</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/all\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ice.gov/news/all</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://notthebee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://notthebee.com/</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found these from other posting them, being referenced by other things, or searching for them. About every few months I do a search for conservative news outlets or aggregators.</p>\n<p>Then I see what my conservative political commentators are talking about etc. Usually a wrap or further discussion of stuff that happened earlier in the week. Good for people who aren\u2019t active in seeing this news. It\u2019s fun/relatable to watch and good for sharing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/markdice\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/markdice</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NextNewsNetwork\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/NextNewsNetwork</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BenSwann\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/BenSwann</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PrisonPlanetLive\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/user/PrisonPlanetLive</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOfficerTatum\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOfficerTatum</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/kevinellerbe\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/user/kevinellerbe</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/prageruniversity\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/prageruniversity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/oann\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/oann</a></p>\n<p>Also White House has events everyday: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteHouse\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteHouse</a></p>\n<p>Now I don\u2019t always watch/check everything. Some days I watch/listen more and some days I don\u2019t. Depends on my mood.</p>\n<p>Now digesting that\u2019s info is another component. Dealing with fake news. Discerning truth means finding sources. Since I am aware of the general political landscape. I know when people say \u201cTrump said this\u201d, I can check the White House for videos of him at events (and probably I already watched). Which means I\u2019ll know if he said and if it\u2019s consistent with his daily character. If it\u2019s about an incident, I may have already heard about it from the anons. While I don\u2019t have Twitter, I can still search it. I will search with hashtags. Or you can use reverse image lookup for original sources. When people talk about a document, I\u2019ll go find it. Sometimes I just copy and paste quotes into search to see where else they pop up. If it\u2019s like an incident, I\u2019ll search YouTube for videos of it or Bitchute.</p>\n<p>But as you can see I have a wholistic net that covers things for different angles and different entities connect. You absorb certain meta information by engaging with it.</p>\n<p>I used to have other methods as well. I used to be on the_donald on reddit, I used to be an active and regular member of that discord as well and people would drop info and other discords. But as I\u2019ve gotten more independent in sourcing my info, I don\u2019t need some of them. Sometimes getting cut off from sources means finding new ways to find information because you are forced to.</p>\n<p>Other days I pivot into active exploring. This where I explore the edges of what I know and further my knowledge in general or fix gaps in my information net, like finding more conservative women perspectives. This is also conspiracy related content and political, philosophical, theological theory.</p>\n<p>And some days I focus more on non-political content.</p>\n<p>Thoughts, questions?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1601057624, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_c57p", "guild_id": "32", "herald_guild": null, "id": "c57p", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent_comment_id": ["c4zh"], "permalink": "/+WhereWeGo1WeGoAll/post/3ivo/mystery-as-doj-fbi-land-a/c57p", "post_id": "3ivo", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["c57p"], "permalink": "/+WhereWeGo1WeGoAll/post/3ivo/mystery-as-doj-fbi-land-a/c5rh", "post": {"author_name": "stars_in_blue_major", "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 8, "created_utc": 1600999258, "domain": "truepundit.com", "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_3ivo", "guild_id": "32", "guild_name": "WhereWeGo1WeGoAll", "herald_guild": null, "id": "3ivo", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+WhereWeGo1WeGoAll/post/3ivo/mystery-as-doj-fbi-land-a", "score": 5, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/3ivo/thumb.png", "title": "MYSTERY as DOJ &amp; FBI Land a 757 Jet in Clinton's Hometown Little Rock, Arkansas; Load It With Boxes &amp; Documents \u2013 True Pundit", "upvotes": 4, "url": "https://truepundit.com/mystery-as-doj-load-it-with-boxes-documents/"}, "post_id": "3ivo", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
