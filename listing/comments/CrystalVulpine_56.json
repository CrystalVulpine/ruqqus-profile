If you are posting it in News is should be notable to everyone's interest. \r\n\r\nA Headline may be changed, for example to more accurately reflect what the body of the article claims or add a quote. \r\n\r\n#2. Personal slant or commentary should go in the comments. News should try and present neutrally to be fair. Let people form their own conclusions or post in sub that is opinionated. No: \"Headline\u2014and this is why this is dumb.\"  This is News not Conclusions. Commentary shows giving opinions on news are not News. To be News, it should be reporting. \r\n\r\nIf it's News but is more an opinion piece please add [Opinion] in the title, or post in +OpinionPieces \r\n\r\nSome types of News may be more worth a focused discussion in +politics or a specific political guild or other topic based guild.

If you are posting it in News is should be notable to everyone's interest.</p>\n<p>A Headline may be changed, for example to more accurately reflect what the body of the article claims or add a quote.</p>\n<p>#2. Personal slant or commentary should go in the comments. News should try and present neutrally to be fair. Let people form their own conclusions or post in sub that is opinionated. No: \"Headline\u2014and this is why this is dumb.\"  This is News not Conclusions. Commentary shows giving opinions on news are not News. To be News, it should be reporting.</p>\n<p>If it's News but is more an opinion piece please add [Opinion] in the title, or post in <a href=\"/+OpinionPieces\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/+OpinionPieces/pic/profile\"/>+OpinionPieces</a></p>\n<p>Some types of News may be more worth a focused discussion in <a href=\"/+Politics\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/+Politics/pic/profile\"/>+Politics</a> or a specific political guild or other topic based guild.
