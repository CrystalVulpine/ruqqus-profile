If it really is all just chance, chance certainly doesn't seem to like me at all.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's that too. Since I don't really know how to explain anything either, I'll just list a bunch of examples of how I discovered specific things on either reddit or ruqqus.\r\n\r\n* Stuff about /r/friends like how posts from suspended users appear there too: Experimentation\r\n* Banned subreddits without timestamps: Discovered by chance from [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/eo35lm/watch_till_the_end/fe8rxzd/)\r\n* \"Chucking\": I found it from you, I think\r\n* Bans where the entire post history is nuked: I found out after /u/Obama_Brigade (Meguminnnn) was banned\r\n* [These types of removals](https://old.reddit.com/r/Offensivejokes/comments/jf0etm/its_not_a_meme_but_im_quite_proud_of_it/): Entirely by chance: I first found it from a different post, but then I lost track of it. I found this particular one from AHS.\r\n\r\nRuqqus:\r\n\r\n* Can't post Endless Summer links in the comments: I found out by looking at someone's post history and finding a comment about it\r\n* Posting Endless Summer links used to get you suspended: I was experimenting with posting it, and I got a 1 day suspension. [I later got captainmeta4 to change that though](https://ruqqus.com/+SomeGuild/post/3pto/link-post/csdt?context=1).\r\n* Arbitrary bugs: Sometimes I find them by chance ([this](https://ruqqus.com/+general/post/2tsk/why-can-i-see-the-box), [this](https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/gei/cant-see-profiles-of-users-whose), and [this](https://ruqqus.com/+DumpsterFire/post/gg9/500-internal-server-error)), sometimes I experiment with things ([this](https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/riy/report-bugs/7444) and [this](https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/riy/report-bugs/1ten)), sometimes I look at the code and try to find something ([this](https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/riy/report-bugs/cim3) and sieging banned guilds)\r\n\r\nSo for me, it is indeed mostly by chance.\r\n\r\n>how to learn and discover on my own like they do, which is 95% of it, they either couldn't explain or in the case of some of them, didn't want to tell\r\n\r\nI'll have to say that it does seem like something that's hard to explain, especially since it's so vague. Maybe try to ask for some specific resources/tools.\r\n\r\n>So many things everyone talks about casually, even in the subjects I'm most interested in, are gibberish to me, and I don't know about 99% of the things that \"everyone just knows\".\r\n\r\nYou can always ask how/where they find out these things that \"everyone just knows\".\r\n\r\n>they don't know something they can easily find the information or are clever enough to produce a solution to it at light speed (compared to me).\r\n\r\nHm, did you ask them where they look for information? Also, coming up with solutions probably took a lot of practice for them. I think that most people aren't that way from the start.\r\n\r\n>I feel so alone because I don't know a single other person who has this problem\r\n\r\nYou can try asking. I'm sure there's someone out there. Honestly, I sometimes sort of feel the same way as you do. I see others doing so well and feel that I'll never be as good as they are (or I'll feel that it's already \"too late\"). But I think that my problem mostly stems from laziness/a lack of motivation.
