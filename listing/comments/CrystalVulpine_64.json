You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states.

Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!\r\n\r\n**Pre-established premises:**\r\n\r\n- *Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.*\r\n- *Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.*\r\n- *So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.*\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nJohn and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.\r\n\r\n**End scenario.**\r\n\r\nWho did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.\r\n\r\nNo one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's *less* harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck? Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal. Even though no one is harmed in these situations.\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of legal gay relations, transsexual nonsense, polyamorous bullshit, even furries and Funko Pop collecting and anime binges and whatever the fuck else all fall apart when the logic used to justify them is applied to anything else with the least bit of substance to it. Supporting these things is - as we have just demonstrated - *morally identical* to supporting John's right to annihilate his dead kid's carcass with his cock.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to reiterate: Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left.

Great job everyone! I wanted to wait until we had 2,000 to write this, but that's taking too long and I'm tired of seeing this inane concession in 90% of my threads here.

You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states. There's no shortage of examples here demonstrating that non-physical harm is quite real. Someone doesn't need to bleed or bruise to be damaged.</p>\n<p>Now, keep that in mind as we move on to the meat of this post: something I call <em>Dead Cummy Baby Theory</em>. Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-established premises:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.</em></li>\n<li><em>Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.</em></li>\n<li><em>So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>\n<p>John and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.</p>\n<p><strong>End scenario.</strong></p>\n<p>Who did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.</p>\n<p>No one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's <em>less</em> harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck? Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal.

After all, what do two dudes who enjoy eating each other's shit in the privacy of their Funko-filled sex dungeon actually *harm*, anyway?\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to briefly touch on the foundation of this argument - the concept of \"harm\" is not strictly limited to physical damage being inflicted on someone. You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states. There's no shortage of examples here demonstrating that non-physical harm is quite real. Someone doesn't need to bleed or bruise to be damaged.\r\n\r\nNow, keep that in mind as we move on to the meat of this post: something I call *Dead Cummy Baby Theory*. Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!\r\n\r\n**Pre-established premises:**\r\n\r\n- *Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.*\r\n- *Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.*\r\n- *So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.*\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nJohn and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.\r\n\r\n**End scenario.**\r\n\r\nWho did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.\r\n\r\nNo one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's *less* harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck? Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal. Even though no one is harmed in these situations.\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of legal gay relations, transsexual nonsense, polyamorous bullshit, even furries and Funko Pop collecting and anime binges and whatever the fuck else all fall apart when the logic used to justify them is applied to anything else with the least bit of substance to it. Supporting these things is - as we have just demonstrated - *morally identical* to supporting John's right to annihilate his dead kid's carcass with his cock.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to reiterate: Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left. That's a quote, write that down.\r\n\r\nThanks for subscribing to my guild \ud83d\udc8b", "body_html": "<p><em>Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left, and I can prove it.</em></p>\n<p>Hey we're at 1,500 members.

Great job everyone! I wanted to wait until we had 2,000 to write this, but that's taking too long and I'm tired of seeing this inane concession in 90% of my threads here. So let's clear this up once and for all. Read in full or don't read at all, we're going to walk through a really basic thought exercise here and it doesn't hold up if you just jump in midway through.\r\n\r\n**Assertion: What someone does to themself or with a consenting adult partner(s) is just fine, so long as it's not harming anyone else.**\r\n\r\nThis seems fine at first blush. After all, what do two dudes who enjoy eating each other's shit in the privacy of their Funko-filled sex dungeon actually *harm*, anyway?\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to briefly touch on the foundation of this argument - the concept of \"harm\" is not strictly limited to physical damage being inflicted on someone. You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states. There's no shortage of examples here demonstrating that non-physical harm is quite real. Someone doesn't need to bleed or bruise to be damaged.\r\n\r\nNow, keep that in mind as we move on to the meat of this post: something I call *Dead Cummy Baby Theory*. Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!\r\n\r\n**Pre-established premises:**\r\n\r\n- *Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.*\r\n- *Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.*\r\n- *So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.*\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nJohn and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.\r\n\r\n**End scenario.**\r\n\r\nWho did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.\r\n\r\nNo one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's *less* harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck? Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal. Even though no one is harmed in these situations.\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of legal gay relations, transsexual nonsense, polyamorous bullshit, even furries and Funko Pop collecting and anime binges and whatever the fuck else all fall apart when the logic used to justify them is applied to anything else with the least bit of substance to it. Supporting these things is - as we have just demonstrated - *morally identical* to supporting John's right to annihilate his dead kid's carcass with his cock.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to reiterate: Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left.

Great job everyone! I wanted to wait until we had 2,000 to write this, but that's taking too long and I'm tired of seeing this inane concession in 90% of my threads here. So let's clear this up once and for all. Read in full or don't read at all, we're going to walk through a really basic thought exercise here and it doesn't hold up if you just jump in midway through.\r\n\r\n**Assertion: What someone does to themself or with a consenting adult partner(s) is just fine, so long as it's not harming anyone else.**\r\n\r\nThis seems fine at first blush. After all, what do two dudes who enjoy eating each other's shit in the privacy of their Funko-filled sex dungeon actually *harm*, anyway?\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to briefly touch on the foundation of this argument - the concept of \"harm\" is not strictly limited to physical damage being inflicted on someone. You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states. There's no shortage of examples here demonstrating that non-physical harm is quite real. Someone doesn't need to bleed or bruise to be damaged.\r\n\r\nNow, keep that in mind as we move on to the meat of this post: something I call *Dead Cummy Baby Theory*. Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!\r\n\r\n**Pre-established premises:**\r\n\r\n- *Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.*\r\n- *Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.*\r\n- *So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.*\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nJohn and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.\r\n\r\n**End scenario.**\r\n\r\nWho did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.\r\n\r\nNo one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's *less* harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck? Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal. Even though no one is harmed in these situations.\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of legal gay relations, transsexual nonsense, polyamorous bullshit, even furries and Funko Pop collecting and anime binges and whatever the fuck else all fall apart when the logic used to justify them is applied to anything else with the least bit of substance to it. Supporting these things is - as we have just demonstrated - *morally identical* to supporting John's right to annihilate his dead kid's carcass with his cock.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to reiterate: Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left. That's a quote, write that down.\r\n\r\nThanks for subscribing to my guild \ud83d\udc8b", "body_html": "<p><em>Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left, and I can prove it.</em></p>\n<p>Hey we're at 1,500 members.

Or a sterile father and his sterile daughter who meet for the first time on her 18th birthday, so as to remove the possibility of her being groomed? No potential for inbreeding in either of those scenarios, and yet the nearly universal consensus is that they too should remain illegal. Even though no one is harmed in these situations.</p>\n<p>Arguments in favor of legal gay relations, transsexual nonsense, polyamorous bullshit, even furries and Funko Pop collecting and anime binges and whatever the fuck else all fall apart when the logic used to justify them is applied to anything else with the least bit of substance to it. Supporting these things is - as we have just demonstrated - <em>morally identical</em> to supporting John's right to annihilate his dead kid's carcass with his cock.</p>\n<p>And so, to reiterate: Homosexuality is literally no different than a man fucking his dead son's corpse until there's nothing left.

Great job everyone! I wanted to wait until we had 2,000 to write this, but that's taking too long and I'm tired of seeing this inane concession in 90% of my threads here. So let's clear this up once and for all. Read in full or don't read at all, we're going to walk through a really basic thought exercise here and it doesn't hold up if you just jump in midway through.\r\n\r\n**Assertion: What someone does to themself or with a consenting adult partner(s) is just fine, so long as it's not harming anyone else.**\r\n\r\nThis seems fine at first blush. After all, what do two dudes who enjoy eating each other's shit in the privacy of their Funko-filled sex dungeon actually *harm*, anyway?\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to briefly touch on the foundation of this argument - the concept of \"harm\" is not strictly limited to physical damage being inflicted on someone. You can see this most easily with the universal opposition to teaching elementary schoolchildren about sex and the eighteen million genders we currently have. You can see this with laws against neurotypical adults having sex with actual retards. You can see this with laws against flashing, and sending unsolicited dick pics in a growing number of states. There's no shortage of examples here demonstrating that non-physical harm is quite real. Someone doesn't need to bleed or bruise to be damaged.\r\n\r\nNow, keep that in mind as we move on to the meat of this post: something I call *Dead Cummy Baby Theory*. Sexy name with an even sexier explanation. Let's talk about dead cummy babies for a bit!\r\n\r\n**Pre-established premises:**\r\n\r\n- *Abortion is legal, therefore legally speaking, an aborted child is not a human being, else abortion would be murder.*\r\n- *Miscarriage caused by poor decisions (drug use, drinking, negligent accidents, etc.) is not criminal in virtually all jurisdictions, therefore the child is doubly not actually a person, else this would be murder or manslaughter.*\r\n- *So long as no non-consenting party is harmed by something, it should be legal.*\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nJohn and Jane are a married couple. They have no living family whatsoever. John impregnates Jane. Jane miscarries at six months. Heartbroken, Jane hands the bloody fetus to John and promptly drowns herself in the tub, unable to cope with the loss of her future child. John dutifully calls 911, paramedics come to collect Jane's body and he gives a report of what happened. John, having fulfilled all legal obligations regarding his deceased wife, strips down and promptly fucks the dead fetus. Just really goes to town on the thing. Splatter everywhere, it's a mess. After achieving climax, he takes the child to the kitchen and severs one of its underdeveloped arms. Waiting for the refractory period to end, John passes the time by using the naturally lubricated (thanks, Jane!) arm to tickle his prostate. Raring to go, John proceeds to once again fuck the absolute shit out of his dead kid. When finished, John cleans up and - ever the sensible man - relocates his new fleshy Fleshlight to the freezer and enjoys himself regularly with it over the course of the next few weeks until the thing is too pulverized from his thrice-daily hammering to feasibly use anymore. Raised well, John knows never to waste anything, and cleverly makes a stew for himself out of the remains of the remains. It lasts a few days and isn't great. No one is ever aware that any of this took place.\r\n\r\n**End scenario.**\r\n\r\nWho did John's actions harm in the above scenario? Absolutely no one. Legally, the miscarried fetus was never a person, so it's not even human remains. Neither John nor Jane have any family, so any half-baked notion of it somehow harming the fetus' relatives is out the door. Jane died, sure, but what if she hadn't and she'd also consented to what John did? Nothing changes, aside from the fact that all parties even tangentially related to the affair consented which gives it more validity (which it didn't even need) than the scene outlined above.\r\n\r\nNo one is harmed by this. Sure, it's absolutely revolting - incestuous pedonecrophilia and all that - but if you look past that, it's exactly as harmless as two dudes buttfucking each other in their bedroom. A strong argument could be made that it's *less* harmful than that, because there can be no lack of consent on the part of the fetus, whereas with the sodomites, one of them could be just too frightened to say no and end up technically raped. No one is harmed by John using his dead child as a cumsock for a few weeks. Should it be legal? If your answer is yes, please get out of my guild and go shoot yourself in the face. If your answer is no, however - why? Because it's so disgusting? Who made you the arbiter of legally acceptable decency in private? Besides that, where is the line between \"gross but acceptable\" and \"too gross to be acceptable\"? What if two same-sex siblings want to fuck?

Not a huge deal to me but it shows their favoritism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are probably a few other things they get that I'm forgetting, and a few things I don't know about. But I know there's more.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But even popularity on its own is a pretty big deal, because it means everything you say and do automatically carries <em>much</em> more weight than everyone else. You pretty much control the whole community. Discord mods who are 1/10 as active as me on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a> itself still get just as many followers, and what the mods are up to is all anyone ever talks about in the discord server, so it definitely happens. Recently it's gotten so ridiculous that I'd call it a form of idolatry or celebrity worship, and it's not like those mods are even intending for that to happen, most of them are just normal people, but the circlejerk worships their gods like humans do, and the admins encourage it. It's probably because the admins distinguish them so much.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1605143458, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1605144395, "fullname": "t3_gm9r", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1581786138, "description": "Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Posts must be questions.
