We had a lot of good discussion and ideas in that thread.\r\n\r\nA lot of the underlying concerns fit into two categories: guildmaster abuse, and lack of communication.  Users were yanking content without regard to whether or not it fit, and Ruqqus itself did not notify users that their content had been yanked.\r\n\r\nWe've come up with a trial solution which we think will address these underlying concerns in a fair manner. We will try this for at least the next week, to see how well it works.\r\n\r\nWe've added a one hour cooldown on yanking. It works as follows:\r\n\r\n* There is a one hour cooldown per-user\r\n* There is also a one-hour cooldown per-guild\r\n* Returning a post to its original guild (i.e. undoing a kick) ignores both cooldowns\r\n* Yanking your own content also ignores both cooldowns.\r\n\r\nExample: I am a guildmaster of +Ruqqus. I yank a random post from +general to +ruqqus. For one hour, I will be unable to yank anything to anywhere. For that same hour, no other guildmaster of +ruqqus will be able to yank content to +ruqqus either, but they will still be able to yank content to other guilds. \r\n\r\nWith these cooldowns in place, we can also address the communication issue. We have added system notifications that are triggered by Yanking. We had left these out in the past since they could be used to spam with repeated kick-yank-kick-yank actions. Since that's no longer possible, we can add notifications without worrying about spam.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this addresses the underlying issues, while still allowing the Yank function to serve its original purpose of allowing unwanted content to find a new home.\r\n\r\nAs always, feedback is welcome below.", "body_html": "<p>Earlier today we posted <a href=\"https://ruqq.us/5law\">a big discussion thread</a> about the Yank mechanic.

Users were yanking content without regard to whether or not it fit, and Ruqqus itself did not notify users that their content had been yanked.</p>\n<p>We've come up with a trial solution which we think will address these underlying concerns in a fair manner. We will try this for at least the next week, to see how well it works.</p>\n<p>We've added a one hour cooldown on yanking. It works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a one hour cooldown per-user</li>\n<li>There is also a one-hour cooldown per-guild</li>\n<li>Returning a post to its original guild (i.e. undoing a kick) ignores both cooldowns</li>\n<li>Yanking your own content also ignores both cooldowns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: I am a guildmaster of <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a>. I yank a random post from <a href=\"/+general\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+general/pic/profile\"/>+general</a> to <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a>. For one hour, I will be unable to yank anything to anywhere. For that same hour, no other guildmaster of <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a> will be able to yank content to <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a> either, but they will still be able to yank content to other guilds.</p>\n<p>With these cooldowns in place, we can also address the communication issue. We have added system notifications that are triggered by Yanking. We had left these out in the past since they could be used to spam with repeated kick-yank-kick-yank actions. Since that's no longer possible, we can add notifications without worrying about spam.</p>\n<p>We hope that this addresses the underlying issues, while still allowing the Yank function to serve its original purpose of allowing unwanted content to find a new home.</p>\n<p>As always, feedback is welcome below.</p>\n", "comment_count": 102, "created_utc": 1607563411, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 12, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_5lw2", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5lw2", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": true, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": "1", "original_guild_name": "general", "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/5lw2/ruqqus-balance-patch-2266-yanking-nerf", "score": 128, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Ruqqus balance patch 2.26.6 - Yanking nerf", "upvotes": 131, "url": ""}, "post_id": "5lw2", "score": 14, "upvotes": 12, "voted": 0}

I have to be taught literally every step of everything, then I can copy it well enough, but never do it on my own.
