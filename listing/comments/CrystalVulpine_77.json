It was about an attack sent to WRD's modmail, not trying to dispense the CP. Yeah that was a stupid for move him to bring it up on discord like that, exactly because it can easily look like something else and this could happen, which it did. It's such a serious thing that people freak out when it's mentioned and jump to conclusions and make accusations, almost like a kind of hysteria, which is what happened here. You saw one message \"trust you with links that probably lead to cp\" and are basing this entire thing on that. In reality he was talking about the troll modmails so he was actually trying to get someone to promise that they *wouldn't* go to the CP links if he sent them to him.\r\n\r\nYou need to quit saying someone's guilty of something just because you suspect it *could* be the case. This is the most severe incident but it's happened before too (ex. firexq was a \"pedo\" for disagreeing with you about a guild ban, jason \"doxxed\" because he mentioned Bardfinn's name ([which you did too btw](https://ruqqus.com/+averageredditor/post/4ifs/bardfinn-says-ruqqus-is-an-amplifier/fnsx)), klenny was permabanned and doxxed by you because he broke the 10 gm limit with alts, which was not against the rules at that time, and dgk was banned for being in \"bad faith\" because you two didn't have the greatest history). You're acting like a reddit mod when you do this. Stop jumping to conclusions when you don't know the full story, especially when you block the person from even being able to tell you their \"excuses\" as you call them. This was a very serious accusation you made, and you harassed Ali into leaving the whole internet *and* could potentially cause him to have to deal with a lot of shit in real life because of your accusations. He is *not* doing cp. Having suspicion and a little bit of evidence is reason to *investigate* something, not come to a conclusion and take action without solid evidence, especially something this serious.

It was about an attack sent to WRD's modmail, not trying to dispense the CP. Yeah that was a stupid for move him to bring it up on discord like that, exactly because it can easily look like something else and this could happen, which it did. It's such a serious thing that people freak out when it's mentioned and jump to conclusions and make accusations, almost like a kind of hysteria, which is what happened here. You saw one message \"trust you with links that probably lead to cp\" and are basing this entire thing on that. In reality he was talking about the troll modmails so he was actually trying to get someone to promise that they <em>wouldn't</em> go to the CP links if he sent them to him.</p>\n<p>You need to quit saying someone's guilty of something just because you suspect it <em>could</em> be the case. This is the most severe incident but it's happened before too (ex. firexq was a \"pedo\" for disagreeing with you about a guild ban, jason \"doxxed\" because he mentioned Bardfinn's name (<a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+averageredditor/post/4ifs/bardfinn-says-ruqqus-is-an-amplifier/fnsx\">which you did too btw</a>), klenny was permabanned and doxxed by you because he broke the 10 gm limit with alts, which was not against the rules at that time, and dgk was banned for being in \"bad faith\" because you two didn't have the greatest history). You're acting like a reddit mod when you do this. Stop jumping to conclusions when you don't know the full story, especially when you block the person from even being able to tell you their \"excuses\" as you call them. This was a very serious accusation you made, and you harassed Ali into leaving the whole internet <em>and</em> could potentially cause him to have to deal with a lot of shit in real life because of your accusations. He is <em>not</em> doing cp. Having suspicion and a little bit of evidence is reason to <em>investigate</em> something, not come to a conclusion and take action without solid evidence, especially something this serious.

Admins allowed people to GM certain(non-ruqqus) guilds with them because they were in an instant reply chat and could talk easily.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't let someone GM a guild if they weren't on discord ATM because if there's an issue I want to be able to get instant replies and be able to contact them easily, and without a proper Ruqqus app with push notifications, it's hard to do that on Ruqqus.  Sentient added me as a GM to <a href=\"/+RuqqusDiscord\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+RuqqusDiscord/pic/profile\"/>+RuqqusDiscord</a> while he's been busy because I'm in the discord and he was able to DM me about it.  I added Friday as a GM to <a href=\"/+Inspirational_Opossum\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Inspirational_Opossum/pic/profile\"/>+Inspirational_Opossum</a> because they're able to DM me on discord.  So I fully understand admins turning to people who are able to instantly get and reply to messages over someone they would have to babysit Ruqqus for.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1607966189, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1607966225, "fullname": "t3_jv0v", "guild_id": "2", "herald_guild": null, "id": "jv0v", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 19, "parent_comment_id": ["juza"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/5mz6/since-jason-was-banned-just-for/jv0v", "post_id": "5mz6", "score": 2, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["jv0v"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/5mz6/since-jason-was-banned-just-for/jv1w", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 1, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 36, "created_utc": 1607648802, "domain": "ruqqus.com", "downvotes": 6, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_5mz6", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5mz6", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/5mz6/since-jason-was-banned-just-for", "score": 1, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/5mz6/thumb.png", "title": "Since jason was banned just for mentioning someone's publically posted real name, then the admins should definitely get banned for ACTUALLY doxxing this user", "upvotes": 5, "url": "https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ghk/i-wonder-if-i-make-captain"}, "post_id": "5mz6", "score": 1, "upvotes": 0, "voted": 0}
