Notice the huge gap in followers between these and the unexplained ones:\r\n\r\n1. @stars_in_blue_major 41 subscribers\r\n\r\n2. @TrumpVoter1 32 subscribers (private profile which may cause a small drop)\r\n\r\n3. @CrystalVulpine 31 subscribers\r\n\r\n4. @LlamaBean 23 subscribers\r\n\r\n5. @Meguminnnn 23 subscribers (seems a tiny bit excessive because he's not *that* active but that could just be luck)\r\n\r\n6. @AsininePorcupine 20 subscribers\r\n\r\n7. @no_chill 20 subscribers\r\n\r\n8. @VILLAIN 19 subscribers\r\n\r\n9. @Bidpots 17 subscribers\r\n\r\nWhat's also weird is how big the gap is. There's **no one** in the 45-65 range. It jumps immediately from 41 all the way to 73. And *all* the ones in the 70-120 range are these unexplained cases.\r\n\r\nI really don't see how this works.
