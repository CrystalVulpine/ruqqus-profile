This is even happening in groups in which you may identify with, just because your beliefs don't match with the loudest, most emotional zealot of whatever your group may be a part of.</p>\n<p>I'm sure many of you are as exhausted as I am at the extremism of both ends of the political spectrum. I'm also sure many are here just to watch, and encourage that all of this all burns.</p>\n<p>I jumped to Ruqqus due to it being open source, and in the hopes of finding a place for open communication and logical discussion. It will only work if we all share a common understanding.</p>\n<p>Free speech is important, and I think good judgement and a little compassion work a lot better than authoritarian censorship, and anger dumping on strangers. That being said... Let's try to keep the conversations going without devolving into extreme/violent language.</p>\n<p>We can keep this community moving towards one thriving with quality memes, witty banter and open dialogue if we just put down the rocks. Thanks m8s.</p>\n<p>+Addendum: I'm trying to respond to posts and PMs, but I've lost at least 15 responses to the ether so far, and 502s and 503s have been kicking my butt all day. This post is not about me. I'm an anonymous user like the rest of you. This active discussion is what I've come here for.

But you can be sure because the admins haven't appointed me to any special positions. These two users were specifically sought out to help the admins in their work, and no one else was even told about it (the most visible examples were guildmastering WRD and being mods of the *official* Ruqqus Discord server). It's not become a problem yet, but it still makes me angry when this kind of stuff happens. It feels like the admins are playing favorites and being unfair to everyone else. Personally I think these privileges should be open for everyone to be considered or limited to admins only. Because as soon as you begin giving anyone preferential treatment, you end up exactly like reddit and digg. It's not yet a huge problem, and I don't blame the admins because nepotism is natural and inevitable, and I'm sure I'm plenty guilty of it myself. The admins probably don't even realize they're doing it. But when people who *aren't admins* are given any authority or positions that are typically reserved for admins, that is a form of corruption. It may not cause any obvious issues at first, but over time they become more and more prideful of themselves, and when they begin seeing themselves as greater than others that's when their minds justify censorship. I know this because I've been researching DefaultMods on reddit for the past 2 years, and that's how it got started. The Ruqqus admins just need to be a lot more careful about how they operate these things imo.

But you can be sure because the admins haven't appointed me to any special positions. These two users were specifically sought out to help the admins in their work, and no one else was even told about it (the most visible examples were guildmastering WRD and being mods of the <em>official</em> Ruqqus Discord server). It's not become a problem yet, but it still makes me angry when this kind of stuff happens. It feels like the admins are playing favorites and being unfair to everyone else. Personally I think these privileges should be open for everyone to be considered or limited to admins only. Because as soon as you begin giving anyone preferential treatment, you end up exactly like reddit and digg. It's not yet a huge problem, and I don't blame the admins because nepotism is natural and inevitable, and I'm sure I'm plenty guilty of it myself. The admins probably don't even realize they're doing it. But when people who <em>aren't admins</em> are given any authority or positions that are typically reserved for admins, that is a form of corruption. It may not cause any obvious issues at first, but over time they become more and more prideful of themselves, and when they begin seeing themselves as greater than others that's when their minds justify censorship.
