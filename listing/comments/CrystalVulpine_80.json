Now it's swaying in the other direction. When I signed up for Ruqqus, I was promised this kind of shit wouldn't swing here, turns out I was wrong to believe that.</p>\n<p>Make of this what you will. If you don't believe me, please, at least take this with a grain of salt. I can't say I'm on anybody's side here. As far as I'm concerned, all I want to do is prevent bullshit like this from turning Ruqqus into what it promised to never become.</p>\n", "comment_count": 113, "created_utc": 1608750285, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 6, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_60wp", "guild_id": "4vm", "guild_name": "ShillWall", "herald_guild": null, "id": "60wp", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+ShillWall/post/60wp/an-inside-look-at-the-rcp", "score": 46, "thumb_url": null, "title": "An inside look at the RCP Discord server.", "upvotes": 51, "url": ""}, "post_id": "60wp", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
