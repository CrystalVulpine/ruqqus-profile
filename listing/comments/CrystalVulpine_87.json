I haven't seen it in its purest form since about a decade ago or maybe even before that, but it's really picked up in the past 1-2 years. Conservatives are now suddenly demanding a strong state, control of the people, censorship, tough laws banning things they determined have a negative impact on society, more restricted individual rights, etc. They've basically become the left with a right-wing agenda. This was a really fast change and it's been shocking to me; I still have trouble believing it. What's the hardest is seeing all my conservative friends changing at once and suddenly going from mostly believers in freedom to solid authoritarians in a really short time. Their fundamental philosophy is such the opposite of what it was, and to me this major shift in thinking is a complete mystery. Ironically, they now closely resemble Joe Biden in his younger days of politics. Of course I still know of many people who believe in the old philosophy, but the majority of their former allies no longer do and now regard them as traitors. I can't wrap my head around what's going on here. Big brother is now watching you from both sides.

When those users abuse their privileges or bend more minor rules, the admins see it differently than with anyone else; they're somewhat friends, and when someone you're friends with does something it looks more justified than it would otherwise. Likewise if someone you have a distrust for does something it seems worse than it otherwise would. I think that's what's happening here. I just think the admins are too carefree about these sorts of problems and incorrectly assert that they're not even happening, because from their perspective it seems normal.
