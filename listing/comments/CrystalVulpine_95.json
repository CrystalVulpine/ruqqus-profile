If so, will you continue to do so, as well as you can, even when you receive either public or private feedback against doing so?*\r\n\r\n* *Members of the Ruqqus user base believe that admins have made decisions based on feelings and personal dislike in the past. In an effort to prevent future occurrences of this, are you willing to add objectivity to your list of commitments?*\r\n\r\n* *Members of the Ruqqus user base feel that you are dismissive and that they no longer know your intentions for the platform. Are you willing to make a commitment to sharing intentions for the platform if and when they change? Are you willing to make a commitment to sharing the objectives of new features with the Ruqqus community?*\r\n\r\n* *Plainly, clearly and honestly; what are your intentions for Ruqqus as a platform and what does the end product look like in terms of community organization, user demographics, and type of platform?*\r\n\r\n* *Do you feel animosity for any portion of your user base?*\r\n\r\n* *Do you feel that having a lower percentage of right-wing users relative to others is beneficial for Ruqqus and/or your profits?*\r\n\r\n* *Do you value and appreciate right-wingers, those with alternative politics or \u201coffensive\u201d views, and users of widely criticized platforms like Voat, Poal.co, and others using Ruqqus?*\r\n\r\n* *Would you prefer a left-wing or apolitical user base over a right-leaning user base?*\r\n\r\n* *Reddit had an issue with brigading and you\u2019ve attempted to implement features that make brigading more difficult on Ruqqus. When confronted with evidence of users organizing brigades and attempts to manipulate the front-page offsite, why do you refrain from penalizing them?*\r\n\r\n* *Are you willing to make a commitment to spending more time communicating with users on Ruqqus.com than on other platforms?*\r\n\r\n**Demands**\r\n\r\n1. *Communicate all information relevant to regular users, guildmasters, and any other role that may be created in the future to those users through Ruqqus.com at least 24 hours prior to announcing it on offsite chat platforms.*\r\n\r\n2.  *Stop banning people from official Ruqqus guilds and communication channels, stop kicking on-topic posts from these guilds, and reverse all previous bans from these guilds and channels.*\r\n\r\n3.  *Delete the Ruqqus Discord server and set up an uncensored chat on an uncensored service where pro-free-speech people can participate, if an offsite chat system is needed.*\r\n\r\n4. *Announce, discuss intention, and receive community feedback on plans for new features as posts in a designated guild prior to implementation and implement polls (for qualified users) to gauge user reception, and act accordingly.
