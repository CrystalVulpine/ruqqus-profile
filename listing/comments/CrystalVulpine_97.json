From the tiniest to the largest things, sfrohne insanely excels. I mean, she is the kind of person who could walk into a room full of people who had done something as a career their entire lives, never having done it before, and blow them away with just a casual attempt. She's creative, ultra intelligent, super brilliant, seems to know almost everything, and is always in the right place at the right time. Just one of those kinds of people. I know a ton of people like that, who are perfect in almost every way, and I've always been really jealous of them because I'm just not like that, try as I might to become that way, it's just not going to happen because I didn't get those genes.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609440707, "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 1609454067, "fullname": "t3_lud1", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#805ad5", "created_utc": 1591719256, "description": "A place to discuss suspended accounts.

Your zeal for freedom is admirable, but your conduct is crossing a line.\r\n\r\nTranslated: You are not allowed to criticize other users not being punished by us, despite the obvious double-standard. Those users have special privileges of admin protection which means their immune to all claims of unfair Terms of Service enforcement. Calling us out on our hypocrisy will result in a sitewide ban under the false reason of \"harassment\".\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/luk2\r\n\r\n>No, your crusade against users who are part of your fictional \"cabal\" is the problem. You have invented a conspiracy in your head, and are now lashing out at people for being part of that imagined conspiracy.\r\n\r\n>I have reached out to you numerous times to explain everything you've ever questioned, yet you persist in harassing users with your dishonest interpretations of out-of-context screenshots. For example, did it not once occur to you that perhaps the Sfrohne screenshot was provided by an actual admin, and not a \"secret\" admin?\r\n\r\n>I am not setting you up to be banned, I am giving you an opportunity to avoid getting banned. Your repeated attacks on people simply for being in the Ruqqus Discord server are unacceptable, and you are dancing on the edge of the \"no targeted harassment\" rule. You should stop now before you fall off.\r\n\r\nTranslated (in paragraph order):\r\n\r\nThe cabal is not real. There is no cabal. There is no RCP. It's all in your imagination. Everything you see is fake. Any screenshots of the cabal are fake. Any evidence is fake. (gaslighting 101)\r\n\r\nIt is a thought crime to publish evidence that goes against our narrative. We will protect those we have selectively chosen from all arguments against them. Criticism is not allowed on our fake free-speech platform. All criticism is considered harassment and now a crime.\r\n\r\n>I am not setting you up to be banned, I am giving you an opportunity to avoid getting banned. \r\n\r\n(can we all just admire what a golden statement that is coming from the retard admins)\r\n\r\nAttacking people for being in the Ruqqus Discord is not allowed. Stop criticizing us at once or you will be promptly banned. Also, any evidence of discord screenshots is fake if it's presented by the other side criticizing the RCP.
