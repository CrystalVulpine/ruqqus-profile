Of course any sane person would realize that this was obviously a joke and that the search would merely return a definition of the term and news stories about busted pedos. Yet cap permabanned sfrohne and removed the post for \"sexualizing minors\".\r\n\r\nHowever, cap then used his admin powers to take a screenshot of the removed post and brag about banning sfrohne in the ruqqus discord server. He posted the text in full without any censors of the supposedly offending links. So by this logic, he HIMSELF has just violated his own rule that he banned sfrohne for, and should now be permabanned.\r\n\r\nAlso in that linked thread, one of his discord friends @AsininePorcupine is going around and reposting the screenshot too! So that user also needs to be banned.\r\n\r\nOf course I'm sure the actual reason is that cap knows the content of that post is meaningless, and just wanted an excuse to ban sfrohne who had began dissenting the discord bullshit like so many other users lately. I'm sure we can all guess who's next, possibly even for this post, which breaks no rules as far as I can tell. After that, I'm guessing other users like @stars_in_blue_major who are active and not part of the discord cabal will get banned too. This is exactly what happened on reddit to give DefaultMods a monopoly over the site, and I predicted it months ago if the admins didn't fix their structure. They didn't, and look at that, now they're calling the entire userbase except the minority on discord \"schizos\".

Of course any sane person would realize that this was obviously a joke and that the search would merely return a definition of the term and news stories about busted pedos. Yet cap permabanned sfrohne and removed the post for \"sexualizing minors\".</p>\n<p>However, cap then used his admin powers to take a screenshot of the removed post and brag about banning sfrohne in the ruqqus discord server. He posted the text in full without any censors of the supposedly offending links. So by this logic, he HIMSELF has just violated his own rule that he banned sfrohne for, and should now be permabanned.</p>\n<p>Also in that linked thread, one of his discord friends <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a> is going around and reposting the screenshot too! So that user also needs to be banned.</p>\n<p>Of course I'm sure the actual reason is that cap knows the content of that post is meaningless, and just wanted an excuse to ban sfrohne who had began dissenting the discord bullshit like so many other users lately. I'm sure we can all guess who's next, possibly even for this post, which breaks no rules as far as I can tell. After that, I'm guessing other users like <a href=\"/@stars_in_blue_major\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@stars_in_blue_major/pic/profile\"/>@stars_in_blue_major</a> who are active and not part of the discord cabal will get banned too.

In fact it's the special people who make the world go round.
