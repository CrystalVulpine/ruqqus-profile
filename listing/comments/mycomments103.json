This is exactly what happened on reddit to give DefaultMods a monopoly over the site, and I predicted it months ago if the admins didn't fix their structure. They didn't, and look at that, now they're calling the entire userbase except the minority on discord \"schizos\". They're abandoning free speech and ruqqus is starting to become <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a>'s personal website instead of an actual platform.</p>\n<p>If the admins have any concern for free speech left at all, they have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Unban sfrohne and even the original poster of that post because you know that's a bullshit accusation over a joke</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Permaban <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> and <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a> because they have repeatedly committed the exact same offense</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Until then I will be boycotting ruqqus and exposing it as having become almost as counterfeit of a free speech site as reddit is. You can find me on <a href=\"https://poal.co\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poal.co</a>, <a href=\"https://notabug.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">notabug.io</a> (Vulptex), <a href=\"https://saidit.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">saidit.net</a> (Vulptex), xaiecon, and comet. The admins need serious reconciliation of themselves with their userbase, and they are just resorting to banning dissent now.</p>\n<p>Update: I knew it! <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/lufl\">is already trying to set me up to be banned</a>!</p>\n<p>Edit: Another thing I've noticed is that these posts tend to be gradually upvoted at first, implying that the general userbase approves of them, and then suddenly plummet to like -10 in just a minute or two. From this I've gathered that the userbase agrees with me, but the discord feels the need to brigade and bomb all of my posts because they threaten their power.</p>\n","comment_count":42,"created_utc":1609442380,"domain":"text post","downvotes":23,"edited_utc":1609443862,"fullname":"t2_69dy","guild_id":"1","guild_name":"general","herald_guild":null,"id":"69dy","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":"2","original_guild_name":"Ruqqus","permalink":"/+general/post/69dy/captainmeta4-and-asinineporcupine-should-be-permabanned","score":-8,"thumb_url":null,"title":"@captainmeta4 and @AsininePorcupine should be permabanned for sexualizing minors, as per the standards they apply to dissenting users","upvotes":12,"url":""},"post_id":"69dy","score":-2,"upvotes":5,"voted":0}

Add the \"uncategorized\" section to the splash page (maybe rename it to \"Other / Miscellaneous\"). (I'm not talking about /categories. I'm talking about the splash page.) Otherwise, the visibility of uncategorized guilds is still going to be hindered.\r\n2. Put a \"Skip and show all\" button right next to the \"Welcome to Ruqqus\" / \"Select Categories\" text for convenience. I know there's already a \"show all\" button at the bottom of the page, but I dislike it when there's no easy-to-find skip button on these types of pages.\r\n3. Can this only apply to the \"home\" page and not the \"all\" page for logged out users? I'm obsessed with archiving the front page of ruqqus on sites like archive.org and archive.is, and I'm not sure if it can still be done. (If the user hasn't chosen any categories yet, then display all categories on the /all page.)\r\n4. It looks like when you first sign up, you get redirected to the /browse page.
