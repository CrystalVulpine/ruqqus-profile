I have been concerned about this since before anyone else even thought about it, back in like June or July, mainly about how the admins were giving special treatment to certain users, most of whom are discord mods, and they have private discussions with them. It was certainly before RCP was even a thing. These people who think RCP is a jewish AHS cabal are nuts, but that doesn't excuse the admins' behavior that people other than myself are finally coming to realize. And RCP could now also become a cabal like the discord mod group.

A good amount of Ruqqord users want to shit on and drive users they don’t like off the site and admins seem to want to replace their base and cater to a more mainstream audience. These users for all intents and purposes hate Ruqqus and Ruqqus users, would be happier on Reddit, and are consistently (purposely) demoralizing when it doesn’t make sense to be. Yet the admins seem more than willing to take cues from them.</p>\n<p>So you have users that are generally popular or at least neutral with the Ruqqus base getting eyed, jumped on, and treated spitefully by the admins because the Ruqqord base hates and constantly complains about those users. Yet, you’ve got those same Ruqqord users in the RCP server planning brigades, sieging and subverting guilds of users they get banned, playing Carps games and being obnoxious to everybody else and the Admins do nothing.</p>\n<p>The admins always side with Ruqqord over the Ruqqus base. Because they don’t like the Ruqqus base.
