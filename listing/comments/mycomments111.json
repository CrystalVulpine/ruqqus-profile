You're comparing groups to a single you and you're an exceptional case, INFPs are quite rare.\r\n\r\nAnd what if there are black people or females who are too? You express distaste for their \"normal\" state, but then propose laws forcing the ones who aren't to conform to it!\r\n\r\n> Nature can't afford to gamble with women which is why they are the safe option, which is why most of their normal distributions (IQ, etc.) lie closer to the average than for men.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's because they make no sense and have a strange obsession with acting as girly as possible at all times. When you use a sample who actually acts normal the difference disappears in my experience; if anything they are usually a bit *more* intelligent than the men, which is just as dumb but that's just how it is.\r\n\r\n> I don't see absolutely anything remarkable about acikek or no_chill, for all I've known of them they're just basic bitches. Not as familiar with other two and Seq37 seems like a fairly normal case of a developer mindset. I suggest you tone your swooning down a little, it feels a bit creepy.\r\n\r\nAcikek is a teenager who is amazing at programming, much more than me who has also been obsessed with it. no_chill joined 5 weeks ago and already got 28 followers, posts super well, and already created the most popular guild, and is funny. Seq is literally good at everything like sfrohne is, just not as shy and not quite as amazing and faultless, but still a lot.\r\n\r\n> Find a single sport where women beat men, I'll wait.\r\n\r\nAh yes, athletic performance determines everything else\r\n\r\n> They have to play in separate leagues even in chess.\r\n\r\nWell then that's just stupid, and I know for a fact sfrohne would crush me every time if we played any kind of strategy game\r\n\r\n> And how do you know what is good and what is not?\r\n\r\n> And what does give you the right to control everyone if not that?\r\n\r\n*Nothing* does!\r\n\r\n> You yourself admit some people are more exceptional than others, especially than you, would you not want such people at the helm?\r\n\r\nThe mighty ones aren't always the best people, in fact they usually aren't, and even if they were they still don't have a right to force their will on others, those people would just be better off if they listened.\r\n\r\n> That applies to Africa too and it's a huge shithole with 0 media. It is their nature and genetic analysis proves that.\r\n\r\nBecause Africa is wilderness where any race would act like that.\r\n\r\n> Planning ahead and simulating outcomes takes a good amount of brain power, which is very well correlated with IQ and there are barely any women at all past the 130 IQ mark due to their normal distribution. The downside is that there are more men below the 80 mark too.\r\n\r\nSo if it's just a matter of distribution, and there are more men who are stupid despite more smarter ones, then how does that make all men automatically better? You admit this means more stupid men too, so your idea that it always makes women always substard makes no sense.\r\n\r\n> I never said explicitly a law should be put in place to enforce it, simple societal discouragement will be enough.\r\n\r\nOkay that's better. As long as you're not trying to force your will on someone else. But you said earlier that we need to deny freedom to women and blacks and jews.\r\n\r\n> Currently it is encouraged, glorified (falsely so, there is no glory in dried ovaries and loneliness for fooled 40-year old women)\r\n\r\nActually there is, singleness is in fact a gift and not everyone can recieve it.\r\n\r\n> and diversity quotas are enforced by law.\r\n\r\nYeah those are bullshit. SJWs go on and on about \"racist sexist misogynist homophobic transphobic islamaphobic bigots\", yet they're the ones insisting we make decisions based on these attributes.\r\n\r\n> Even men don't play strategy games that often, women even less so, especially grand strategy, and, guess what, those require long-term planning to win along with a strong attention span.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it's because most women are just weird and girly.\r\n\r\n> Jews maybe, but others nah.\r\n\r\nI literally gave you several examples, and you're blatantly choosing to ignore them because it doesn't confirm your fascist utopia.\r\n\r\n> Sorry about the wording, what I wanted to ask is how much you actually enjoy playing them\r\n\r\nI would enjoy them a lot, if I could actually do them.\r\n\r\n> And lemme tell you something, prejudices are actually GOOD, because, if the prejudice is wrong, it only gives you opportunity to rise up further than you could if you're a decent person (say you become a 6 from a -2, it's an 8 point rise compared to a 6 from 0).\r\n\r\nI don't really get what you're saying here.\r\n\r\n> Who said Jesus is a villain? I'd much rather call those who killed him villains and I think you can guess who that is.\r\n\r\nThey were, and they were *his own people*. I'm not surprised you wouldn't like him, he had quite a bit of concern for people you seem to think are worthless (ironically you have much in common with da joos who got him crucified because that is one of the things they hated about him). I bet you think he's the pinnacle of Jewish brainwashing.\r\n\r\n> Yeah, we can only guess, but judging by how successful his country was during his short reign until it got ganged upon by the entire world, I tend to think he was a good genius with good intentions.\r\n\r\nOr he was just obsessed with power and success. If having a more efficient society costs your entire well-being and causes you to live in terror every second of your life and give up your freedom in almost every aspect, is that really worth it? I wouldn't make that trade-off.\r\n\r\n> How is that unfortunate? It increases biodiversity and makes things more fun.\r\n\r\nIt's only fun for the people who have the advantages.\r\n\r\n> Also, you do realise that a genius woman would be more useful if she produced genius children than if she burned away at some useless job?\r\n\r\nYou could say the same exact thing about a man. I'd also like to add, your idea of meaning seems is purely biological and you seem to have no spiritual discernment.\r\n\r\n> neural networks can very easily determine your race by scaling your genetics\r\n\r\nYes, by looking at that trait, not your other ones.\r\n\r\n> there aren't trillions of traits, lmao, there aren't even that many alleles.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case then how is everyone unique except identical twins? By your logic there should be several clones of everyone.\r\n\r\n> You can refuse a burger, but how often do you choose to, especially when suffering no punishment?\r\n\r\nAgain, there are people who do and it's not fair to judge them by others' actions.

When you use a sample who actually acts normal the difference disappears in my experience; if anything they are usually a bit <em>more</em> intelligent than the men, which is just as dumb but that's just how it is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't see absolutely anything remarkable about acikek or no_chill, for all I've known of them they're just basic bitches.

The downside is that there are more men below the 80 mark too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if it's just a matter of distribution, and there are more men who are stupid despite more smarter ones, then how does that make all men automatically better? You admit this means more stupid men too, so your idea that it always makes women always substard makes no sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I never said explicitly a law should be put in place to enforce it, simple societal discouragement will be enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay that's better. As long as you're not trying to force your will on someone else. But you said earlier that we need to deny freedom to women and blacks and jews.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Currently it is encouraged, glorified (falsely so, there is no glory in dried ovaries and loneliness for fooled 40-year old women)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually there is, singleness is in fact a gift and not everyone can recieve it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and diversity quotas are enforced by law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah those are bullshit. SJWs go on and on about \"racist sexist misogynist homophobic transphobic islamaphobic bigots\", yet they're the ones insisting we make decisions based on these attributes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even men don't play strategy games that often, women even less so, especially grand strategy, and, guess what, those require long-term planning to win along with a strong attention span.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like I said, it's because most women are just weird and girly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jews maybe, but others nah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I literally gave you several examples, and you're blatantly choosing to ignore them because it doesn't confirm your fascist utopia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorry about the wording, what I wanted to ask is how much you actually enjoy playing them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would enjoy them a lot, if I could actually do them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And lemme tell you something, prejudices are actually GOOD, because, if the prejudice is wrong, it only gives you opportunity to rise up further than you could if you're a decent person (say you become a 6 from a -2, it's an 8 point rise compared to a 6 from 0).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't really get what you're saying here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who said Jesus is a villain? I'd much rather call those who killed him villains and I think you can guess who that is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They were, and they were <em>his own people</em>. I'm not surprised you wouldn't like him, he had quite a bit of concern for people you seem to think are worthless (ironically you have much in common with da joos who got him crucified because that is one of the things they hated about him). I bet you think he's the pinnacle of Jewish brainwashing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, we can only guess, but judging by how successful his country was during his short reign until it got ganged upon by the entire world, I tend to think he was a good genius with good intentions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or he was just obsessed with power and success. If having a more efficient society costs your entire well-being and causes you to live in terror every second of your life and give up your freedom in almost every aspect, is that really worth it? I wouldn't make that trade-off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How is that unfortunate? It increases biodiversity and makes things more fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's only fun for the people who have the advantages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, you do realise that a genius woman would be more useful if she produced genius children than if she burned away at some useless job?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could say the same exact thing about a man. I'd also like to add, your idea of meaning seems is purely biological and you seem to have no spiritual discernment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>neural networks can very easily determine your race by scaling your genetics</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, by looking at that trait, not your other ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there aren't trillions of traits, lmao, there aren't even that many alleles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that's the case then how is everyone unique except identical twins? By your logic there should be several clones of everyone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can refuse a burger, but how often do you choose to, especially when suffering no punishment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, there are people who do and it's not fair to judge them by others' actions. I myself am often annoyed by stuff that everyone else just does.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that's just one gene of which there are many, which are more prevalent in blacks than whites or vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You just got done saying there's only a few genes that determine everything!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just watch your TV and physically count how many times there is a black man with a white woman in an ad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's called woke college SJWs who are 90% white men, not jews.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_in_the_closet_(idiom)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_in_the_closet_(idiom)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone's got that, but I'm not sure how that relates to this.

And my blackpilled narrative of being doomed to suck at everything that no one else believes me about is one case of that.

Until that changes you won't be able to see my point of view.\r\n\r\nI'm not, and most of the other people who don't agree with your obsession with destroying da jooz, wahmenz, and blackz aren't either.\r\n\r\n> If you've lost the genetic lottery, which you might've claimed, it means you aren't average and your experiences aren't going to be average. Instead of wallowing in nihilism however, you should use your non-average point of view to come to useful edge-case conclusions. The reason why \"nature experiments on men\" is so fringe men can find unusual paths. You have a purpose, it just seems that you either haven't found or accepted it, or maybe your environment is not conducive to it. You have to keep in mind that nature is metal and makes mistakes of which you might be one, but I doubt it's the case.\r\n\r\nSo if this applies to me, then why not to women and blacks?\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think I'm an experiment.
