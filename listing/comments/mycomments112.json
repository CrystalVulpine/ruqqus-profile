Its stated goal was to stomp out misogyny and other badthink on reddit. \r\n\r\nBack then reddit was a pretty nice place. Those were the days of Ron Paul and the place was full of techies and libertarians. You could speak your mind in larger subreddits without being instantly banned. Free speech was still something that was universally valued.\r\n\r\nThe actual goals of SRS were entirely different. Let's say you and a small group of your friends wanted to take down reddit. How would you go about it? A direct attack would surely fail. But there are tactics that work against larger institutions, and that is using the weaknesses of that institution to make it attack itself from within. \r\n\r\nTheir tactics included:\r\n\r\n - Coordination outside of reddit\r\n - Mass reporting of posts and subreddits\r\n - Coordinating with the media to publish hit pieces\r\n - Attacking fringe communities\r\n - False flag attacks: posting content that was illegal or against reddit rules to get subreddits banned\r\n - Kept lists of users and subreddits to target\r\n - Worked with reddit admins or had admin sympathizers\r\n\r\nI'm sure there were other, more nefarious tactics used, but I haven't witnessed them personally.\r\n\r\nThey seem to derive pleasure from exercising their power and destroying what others have built. They are the kind of people who find pleasure in destroying another kid's sandcastle rather than building their own.\r\n\r\nOther subreddits were created later, like AgainstHateSubreddits, which used similar tactics. \r\n\r\nPartly through their efforts reddit is what it is today.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to the cabal that has infested ruqqus.

Its stated goal was to stomp out misogyny and other badthink on reddit.</p>\n<p>Back then reddit was a pretty nice place. Those were the days of Ron Paul and the place was full of techies and libertarians. You could speak your mind in larger subreddits without being instantly banned.
