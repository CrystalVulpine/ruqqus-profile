They tend to pick the same people for most things, and just think that they can and should be trusted with more privileges than everyone else, ethics slipping their mind in this instance since they think it's not a big deal. When those users abuse their privileges or bend more minor rules, the admins see it differently than with anyone else; they're somewhat friends, and when someone you're friends with does something it looks more justified than it would otherwise. Likewise if someone you have a distrust for does something it seems worse than it otherwise would. I think that's what's happening here. I just think the admins are too carefree about these sorts of problems and incorrectly assert that they're not even happening, because from their perspective it seems normal.
