Currently we are the point where it is made up of like-minded people who can be trusted and support Ruqqus's goals. Most people don't see any problem yet. I only do because this is similar to how reddit's cabal got started, innocent enough at first that most people don't think about it until it's too late. It will probably remain in this state for several years. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have caught on either, as I wasn't looking for it myself, but I happen to know two people in this group on Ruqqus, so they're more recognizable to me, and seeing them listed everywhere that involves the admins got my attention.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was two users becoming guildmasters of +WatchRedditDie, which the admins run. I know of at least 2 other /r/WatchRedditDie mods here not including myself that were not invited. However, since Ruqqus lacks a PM feature, Ruqqus relies on Discord for this (terrible idea imo) and only those two have Discord accounts. So this was most likely just a coincidence and unrelated to the recent developments, although the admin interactions with them could have been setting the stage.\r\n\r\nAfter /u/spez started the giant banwave and the Discord server got flooded is when things got more interesting. Prior to this, the only people with authority on the server were the admins. However, they needed to add more mods now because they couldn't keep up with the influx. Contrary to popular belief, this *was* confirmed to be based on users' suggestions, not just the admins picking people they knew, although I don't doubt that it influenced their decisions. Unfortunately that was the last time the admins were willing to discuss anything regarding moderation or management with the Ruqqus userbase.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the admins made a private channel between them and the mods, and also started talking to them directly in DMs. This was a very bad decision imo. Keep in mind that the Discord server is *official*, and the admins are being untransparent here about what they and these mods are doing.\r\n\r\nAs the admins got to know these mods more, they of course became more withdrawn from the rest of the site. They now *refuse* to discuss anything about moderation or management of Ruqqus or the Discord server with anyone except the Discord mods. Even worse, it is currently *impossible* to become one of those mods if you're not one already. The mods suggested that this be changed too, but the admins just say something about a future plan and ignore them. Now, if anyone except these mods makes suggestions to the admins about how they manage either Ruqqus or the server, they tell you something along the lines of \"you don't have the right to give us your input\". The only people they are willing to discuss these things with now are the Discord mods, usually in their private channel. And it's bleeding out into the main site too, as these mods are also being made guildmasters of the official admin-run guilds. In fact some of the guilds were created from the mods' ideas, and I highly doubt the admins would give anyone else that sort of attention.\r\n\r\nThis lines up with the recent questionable activity, such as users being banned for reasons that aren't stated in the content policy, and the admins saying \"we don't care what you think\" when inquired about it. This is nothing like their prior attitude.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that these mod groups together with the admins becomes cliques, and in the future they always end up ruining things. I'm sure we have a few years yet, but as soon as the current good members leave and get replaced by less trustworthy mods, the censorship will start. To anyone who remembers this from reddit or even digg, please pay attention, because we're seeing it again. Do we want this to happen a third time now? I know for a fact the admins don't want a cabal, but they don't realize that they already started one. Unfortunately, they now brush off all concerns about it. This is the one thing they won't even talk to the mods about.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**How this can be fixed:**\r\n\r\n1. Stop relying on fucking *Discord* for everything. In a way, Discord caused all of this. The admins needed new mods frantically to enforce Discord's insane TOS, which caused a chain recation that already has effects on the main site now. Ruqqus needs its own chat function, and a PM feature. I don't think using a platform literally run by reddit DefaultMods jannies such as allthefoxes, the guy who had /u/spez take over /r/yiffinhell for him, is in Ruqqus's interests. I don't have anything against the admins for choosing it, as it is the most popular choice and appeals to the most people, but I think it needs corrected. Admins should remove the links to the discord server from Ruqqus's pages, give ownership of it to the mods, and stop associating with it, instead focusing on something different.\r\n\r\n2. Don't have non-admins managing parts of the site (meaning the official stuff, not non-admin guilds) until there's a way to actually get those positions. Right now you *can't* become a mod unless you were already chosen to be one, which can be greatly abused.\r\n\r\n3. Make the moderation/feature discussions with the admins open and transparent. Don't limit this ability to only the mods. Don't be having private \"mod chats\" where the mods get more insider information, privileges, and say than what's supposed to be avaiable to end users. Don't only listen to the mods. This is all especially true considering point #2. If this is not done it opens to door for an admin-mod clique to form (already true now), and then eventually a cabal. Unlike the admins seem to think, just because someone isn't one of their mods shouldn't mean their suggestions don't matter and shouldn't be heard.\r\n\r\n4. Don't make non-admins guildmasters or managers of official parts of the site. If help is actually needed, have a way for users to become mods, not just DMing specific people and asking if they can do it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe admins probably won't care about this post since I'm not a mod. Unfortunately, the only way this will change is if we get their attention. Please make this known throughtout Ruqqus whenever you can and encourage people to speak up about it. If you support this site right now, it is your *duty* to do so to keep Ruqqus what it is. Your efforts are highly worth it and greatly appreciated, because unlike reddit, Ruqqus can still be fixed. It's not *that* broken yet, but the cracks will get bigger and bigger until they're repaired. Remember, the more people that know about this, the better chance we have at fixing it.\r\n\r\nIf any of the mods are reading this, do the same thing. But you play a special role here. Bring this up in the mod channels and admin guilds from time to time. Let the admins know you will not stand for a powermod cabal. And post the admins' responses about it so we can know where we're at. Other than that, be extra careful with your power, and thank you for all the time you've taken to help Ruqqus.","body_html":"<p>As the creator of /r/The_Cabal I know quite a bit about these powermod cabal power structures and how they work.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>\n<a href=\"/@no_chill\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@no_chill/pic/profile\"/>@no_chill</a>\n<a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a>\n<a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a>\n<a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a>\n<a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>\n<a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a>\n<a href=\"/@SomeoneAtThePhone\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@SomeoneAtThePhone/pic/profile\"/>@SomeoneAtThePhone</a>\n<a href=\"/@Bidpots\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Bidpots/pic/profile\"/>@Bidpots</a>\n<a href=\"/@VILLAIN\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@VILLAIN/pic/profile\"/>@VILLAIN</a>\n<a href=\"/@freeday\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@freeday/pic/profile\"/>@freeday</a>\n<a href=\"/@notabot\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@notabot/pic/profile\"/>@notabot</a>\n<a href=\"/@Regmadan\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Regmadan/pic/profile\"/>@Regmadan</a>\n<a href=\"/@l1terally_h1tler\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@l1terally_h1tler/pic/profile\"/>@l1terally_h1tler</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","comment_count":109,"created_utc":1608245001,"domain":"text post","downvotes":27,"edited_utc":1608415802,"fullname":"t2_5uh4","guild_id":"xu","guild_name":"DeuxRAMA","herald_guild":null,"id":"5uh4","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+DeuxRAMA/post/5uh4/the-grand-story-of-the-rcp","score":30,"thumb_url":null,"title":"The grand story of the RCP and the greatest troll op in Ruqqus history","upvotes":60,"url":""},"post_id":"5uh4","score":-3,"upvotes":4,"voted":0}
