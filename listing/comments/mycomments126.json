I've been drawing for over 8 years, which means I do have some experience/practice. (I've never taken classes on digital art though, and I don't know that much about perspective/shading since I just draw for fun). I just don't really post any of my drawings online. (You definitely have a lot more experience in programming though.)\r\n3. Like Seq37 said, my drawing isn't exactly perfect. There's some misalignment at the bottom, and I also wasn't sure how to get it to be symmetric (I drew the left side first, and I copied and pasted it to make the right side, but I had trouble connecting the two sides together), so it ended up having some asymmetry.\r\n4. I don't really just \"skim over\" the code and see bugs every time. Like Seq37 said, I think I also try to look at individual lines and try to think of ways to \"abuse\" them. I usually try to think of things like unconventional inputs or cases that the devs may have forgotten about.\r\n5.

The ears were kind of based on elf ears, but that's it. I'm sort of wondering what you thought the features meant (if you can find meaning from them, that would be pretty cool).\r\n\r\nWhat I did here was that I tried to think of the general shape of the creature (is it humanoid, is it a blob, is it an object, is it something else?), and I tried to think of what it should have on each part of the body (What should it have on the head? Should it have arms or wings or anything like that? Are there any features that would make it feel medieval?) However, if you'd like advice on coming up with ideas, I'm probably not the best person to ask since I usually have trouble with it (I tried to think of a flag for ruqqus a while back and still haven't come up with anything).\r\n\r\nI actually think your depiction is pretty good (in my opinion, at least). I think that some changes I would make is that I'd make the mouth and the bottom of the crown a bit rounder (I drew the crown on mine using triangles and an oval), and I'd make the arms a bit less thin. I also think that the shading on the left is a bit awkward (it makes the arm seem flat, and the bottom is not connected to the edge of the body), but since I'm not that knowledgeable about shading, I don't really know how to fix it. (If I were to do it, I'd probably end up making the entire left side of the body darker, assuming the light is coming from the top right.)\r\n\r\n>Acikek is similar to sfrohne and is also much younger than I am, yet also does everything consistently and solidly\r\n\r\nI usually feel this way too when seeing someone who's younger and lot more talented than I am.

I think that if you want to improve on drawing, for example, you can try showing one of your drawings to someone who's better at it and ask for advice.
