I have to be taught literally every step of everything, then I can copy it well enough, but never do it on my own.

Not having a specific talent prevents you from resting on your laurels and it leaves you open to more possibilities.\nYou're not as awful and hopeless as you think. You're just always focusing on people who do better than you.\nBut you probably mostly post all of this stuff so that people will give you pep talks. I used to do that. What if people got tired of it and just ignored you completely? People do get tired of it.\nBirds, flowers and trees don't need to be talented or \"special\" to be valuable and beautiful. Neither do you.</p>\n","created_utc":1607026423,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_irgi","guild_id":"2l6","herald_guild":null,"id":"irgi","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["iq0m"],"permalink":"/+YANKED/post/5emy/studies-say-that-if-youre-not/irgi","post_id":"5emy","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["irgi"],"permalink":"/+YANKED/post/5emy/studies-say-that-if-youre-not/irkl","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":12,"created_utc":1606966304,"domain":"frontiersin.org","downvotes":2,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_5emy","guild_id":"2l6","guild_name":"YANKED","herald_guild":null,"id":"5emy","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":"1","original_guild_name":"general","permalink":"/+YANKED/post/5emy/studies-say-that-if-youre-not","score":3,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/5emy/thumb.png","title":"Studies say that if you're not born with the talent, don't waste your time trying","upvotes":5,"url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02396/full"},"post_id":"5emy","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}

I became fed up with the establishment early in life and began questioning things. Otherwise I'd have never noticed anything. I also have many interests (and I suck at doing all of them). There's a difference between smart and genius. Smart is what you work for and accumulate over years of work, study, research, and practice. Anyone can become smart, and I'm very smart in many areas. However, I'm definitely not a genius. Genius is what you're born with, talent and intelligence. Geniuses have an instinct or intuition that allows them to start out 10x better at something without trying than the most hard-working non-genius will ever get to. Genius is a whole new level, and it's not available for everyone. Geniuses are naturally smart, and unfortunately as a smart person, especially in an open-source community full of these people, almost everyone I know is a genius. I can't do anything they can do. I'm a tryhard, a wannabe or whatever. My existence here, at least in the early stages of this site, is pointless.

I'm the type who can pretend to be gifted, get good grades, etc. But when it really comes down to it, I'm nothing special. For example, you all are the people who can legitimately figure out a complicated math or science problem, whereas I can never do that. I have to be taught literally every step of everything, then I can copy it well enough, but never do it on my own. This is *crucial* for anything I want to accomplish myself; anytime I need to do something that's not been done before, I simply can't. I can't figure anything out. I can only copy others' methods. Yet you all have that genius instinct, to know how to do all these amazing things. I can't do that. I don't belong with you. You are all innovators. I am not, am uncreative, can't think outside the box, a talentless hack, etc. You are the people who make a difference.
