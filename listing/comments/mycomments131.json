The only thing I'm good at is burdening people with my problems. I used to have a some creativity at least when I was young but of course that went away as I got older and went through puberty and I can't ever even have that back! Damnit, what am I ever going to do with this situation! If I only knew even one other person on the whole planet who could sympathize with me. But no, you're all perfect and flawless and have superpowers compared to me, in real life and online. I need to give up on everything, my every effort is 100% in vain. But I'm not a passive consumer, and I can't just do that! Why am I like that when I don't have what it takes?

It's not what anyone wants to hear, but it's reality, people are <em>not</em> equal and life isn't fair. However, don't change your attitude, because you might have a shot at whatever it is you want to do, and your confidence is a good thing in case you are capable.

NOT **ONE** OTHER PERSON HERE HAS A SINGLE FAULT EXCEPT FOR ME! I can't do anything right. Even the smallest things I try to do fall apart immediately, and everyone else just keeps moving along achieving pretty much anything they want if they set their mind to it. Sure, they fail some, but at least not all the time! And I've had it with everyone trying to sugarcoat it and make it seem like it's not a big deal, because it is. Whenever there's any kind of group project or organization, guess who's the only one not invited every single time? You guessed it, it's me! And they're not bullying me, it's because they know at a subconscious level that I'm not worth the dust beneath my paws, even the ones who have tried to deny this know it, and their actions prove it. Stop lying to me, the evidence is right in front of all of us! Not one thing I attempt ever finishes, and even if it would it'd be a huge mess and so much less than everyone else can do in a fraction of the time and effort. Now you may say, \"Oh, I couldn't do what you did!\". But you've never tried or been interested have you? Exactly. I don't and can't do even *one thing* halfway decently. Don't give me that 10000 hours crap or whatever, it hasn't worked at all for me and no one else even needs it. It's a myth, and even science has proven that, along with common sense. Practice accounts for maybe 0.1-10% of the difference, the rest is just innate intelligence that you have to be born with, not a fucking thing you can do about it. And everyone here has that in every field except me! I don't even know *one* other person who has this problem, I'm completely alone. Here everyone else is doing all sorts of crazy things and I can't even find a fox picture on the internet after searching for 2 hours with years of experience. I'm always out of the loop, super dull, can barely even think. I do a few things somewhat well but I'm faking it. They consist of a few specific things I've seen other people do and copying it robotically, with literally no understanding. I literally can't do *anything* else. Everyone else can at least do the thing they've been doing all the time for years, usually more than that, but me, nope, not even mediocre at one fucking thing! Not one hobby, not one game, not one subject, nothing! I'm uncharismatic, dull, forgetful, and just utterly incompetent! I'm a born loser, a wannabe in every way, and I just don't know how to play these cards! I get nothing but frustration and failure. This is so fucking unfair! The only thing I'm good at is burdening people with my problems. I used to have a some creativity at least when I was young but of course that went away as I got older and went through puberty and I can't ever even have that back! Damnit, what am I ever going to do with this situation! If I only knew even one other person on the whole planet who could sympathize with me. But no, you're all perfect and flawless and have superpowers compared to me, in real life and online. I need to give up on everything, my every effort is 100% in vain. But I'm not a passive consumer, and I can't just do that! Why am I like that when I don't have what it takes? I have no peace with myself, I can't just accept it, I don't want to waste my whole life in this miserable state. Someone please help me, I am falling apart! And please don't try to feed me more sugarcoated politically correct nonsense, that is not helping!
