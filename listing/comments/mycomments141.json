It may be possible, but they still target you with a ton of merch on Bedrock which they can't do on the original game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Merch has existed long before Bedrock.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because one is trying to control another's private affairs, and the other isn't.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not just \"their\" private affairs when it involves someone else's property.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, malware is a form of fraud and hacking and infecting people's machines without their consent is illegal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But but Mojang has no business interfering with how private servers run themselves so they would be forced to allow me to continue doing this right?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes they do. Unless they just run the server without having bought the game, but even then that was Mojang's decision to let them do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No they don't. They don't own that server jar that they use to launch their server instance. That's on lease from Mojang on the condition of your acceptance of their terms of service.  Actually on top of that, and I was being nice by not bringing this up earlier, but since the server software is on \"lease\" does Mojang not have a right to protect their brand? If all these P2W servers were allowed to continue new people might get the impression that Minecraft is just another P2W shitfest which would harm sales. Why should these server owners be allowed to harm sales? Would that not violate the NAP? Mojang has bills to pay, developers to pay, and what other solution would you offer to deal with a potential hindrance to that if you were Jeb? The only other options I can think of are much worse, like blacklisting those servers in the Minecraft client which means those servers are dead even if they do change to comply with the TOS [like many did while keeping monetization in a healthy way]. Even if all they did was release an official statement against these servers, they're still permanently harmed without any path to recovery as even if they do change they still have that impression of being P2W trash servers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I'm advocating not letting them or you control servers you're not involved with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their servers are involved with Mojang simply by virtue of running Mojang's software. Don't like it? Switch to hosting something else. Stop taking those Minecraft bux.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So why the \"I paid money and want to have input on how it's used\" argument?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's on the users, not the server ops.</p>\n","created_utc":1603805941,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1603806268,"fullname":"t3_ey8q","guild_id":"1u","herald_guild":null,"id":"ey8q","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":14,"parent_comment_id":["ey50"],"permalink":"/+Minecraft/post/47o4/you-can-now-be-banned-from/ey8q","post_id":"47o4","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["ey8q"],"permalink":"/+Minecraft/post/47o4/you-can-now-be-banned-from/f3q6","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"I'm not just talking about server bans.

You think there should be zero rules anywhere for anything and that people should be able to do whatever they want, and I hate to tell ya but even in an ancap society there's going to be rules. You have the NAP for one but communities may agree upon a set of rules.\n\n>  I could sell you a drink on the condition that you can't give it to anyone else, but it would be extremely petty and dictorial and few people would agree to that. Why is this any different? Plus, it's unMinecraft-like: all the initial terms and conditions for MC were written solely to protect Mojang from legal issues. \n\nSo basically if I buy a Honda, I should be allowed to strap it up with C4 and drive it right into Honda corp HQ and detonate the C4?\n\n> They clearly had no actual interest in them until recent years when Jeb suddenly decided to start enforcing it for no reason.\n\nNo, he enforced it because of legitimate community outcry, not the outcry of a select few privileged community members since I know you will bring up Reddit again.\n\n> In fact, Notch actually had plans to completely open-source Minecraft in the future (I assume this was botched by MS though) and it practically is even because of MCP.\n\nYeah, well guess who made the decision to sell Minecraft to Microsoft in the first place, who took the offer. It wasn't Jeb so that narrows it down a bit.\n\n> That's literally like saying, \"you say you don't like tyranny, but aren't you guilty of the same thing by telling Democrats and Republicans they can't use big government to control people?\"\n\nDo you even know what tyranny is? Because you seem to conflate the existence of rules as tyranny when in reality tyranny is defined as \"cruel and oppressive government or rule\" and I would not consider telling cancer to stop being cancer as cruel, and last time I checked Mojang isn't a government they're a private entity. If Mojang wanted to be tyrannical they'd force server owners to pay a license fee to host Minecraft servers (when in fact you don't even need to own the game to run a server, you can straight up download the server jar for free) or go after 2B2T.\n\n> No, they shouldn't be banning people at all, nor should they be shutting down servers they don't like.\n\nWait wait wait hold on here, so you're saying that a private server operator should be disallowed from banning someone from his own server? Ok so they can host P2W, but not ban users who disrupt the server?\n\n> If you want to do something in a world, does Mojang have to do it for you?\n\nIf it's an issue involving Minecraft, ummmm yes they do since it's their product.\n\n> Of course not, and likewise they shouldn't have to manage your server for you either. As for accounts, you're likening it to an account on a website when in reality it's little more than a way to purchase the game.\n\nThey're not managing servers, they're enforcing the license agreement that these server operators agreed to. Also, it's actually a bit more than \"just a way to purchase the game\" it's actually an integral part of Minecraft multiplayer and pretty much always has been. Even before Microsoft bought Minecraft if you were not authenticated to your Mojang account you were not going to be connecting to any servers unless they disabled the authentication which some such as the Meloncraft example someone else brought up. \n\n> Didn't know we were talking about alts, which I don't recall not being allowed, but anyway this is a problem that's practically impossible to solve.\n\nStop being dishonest, we're talking about the sale of accounts which is primarily used to enable alt accounting. Hell there's even 3rd party launchers that connect to a service where you can swap alts on the fly specifically for server ban-evasion.\n\n> Mojang can do little more than the server.\n\nWell other than ban the account, which again is their right as per the agreement you made with them when you purchased their software.\n\n> As you can see on any website, the only solution is IP or machine address banning, things that are so easily manipulated that even intelligence agencies can't trace them, and IP bans are already available to servers. Evaders will always get around anything. This is one reason I don't think \"ban evasion\" in itself should be an offense at all, the other being that it's super petty\n\nOr you can remove the account being used for said evasion.\n\n> and if they start breaking the same rules again, just ban them for the same reason again. Eventually they'll get tired of it, and in the case of Minecraft it's at least a little easier since they'd soon not want to keep paying for new alts all the time.\n\nLmao, yeaaaaaaah you don't know how that works if you think they are going to get bored. I would hope you would know that some people take their block game very seriously.\n\n> I highly doubt that there would be a scenario where every single server became P2W. Even if most of them did, there are still thousands of servers just being made for fun which are unlikely to ever have that.\n\nYeah a server between friends is totally the same as Mineplex, Hypixel, etc etc.\n\n> Do you think they'd just come out and say it immediately? No, that would be suicide. They want to phase it out slowly so less people notice.\n\nThey won't do it ever, and even if they did start we'd have years of notice specifically for the server issue I mentioned.\n\n> That's part of a deeper MS plan. They don't want people using any other OS than Windows 10, so they purposely make everything as incompatible as possible with anything else. It's actually quite smart, they want people who don't use W10 to be screwed and compelled to switch when Java is abandoned, or perhaps even completely disabled. It's the exact same crap Apple does all the time with its Mac-only software.\n\nYeah, no. Microsoft for whatever true intention has been decoupling themselves more and more from Windows 10. They've been releasing more and more software for Linux and tbh I don't see Microsoft Office 365 for Linux being far behind, and on top of that their Xcloud streaming is only available on Android, no app for Windows 10.\n\n> Do you really think Microsoft cares? They probably would have a decade ago, but now they've followed in Apple's footsteps and only care about the 5-year-olds wanting to buy that ingame merch that would've been a freely available mod or texture pack or skin on Java.\n\nYeah I am sure they will purposefully kill the 2nd most selling game on the planet.\n\n> Most glaringly, mods. Yes Bedrock mods exist but they're very limited and I believe it's also illegal. I'm not as sure on this one but I remember hearing that custom skins and texture packs are also forbidden for Bedrock.\n\nNo, datapacks on Bedrock while super limited are free.

Why the double-standard?\n\n> You seem to be thinking of Minecraft as a service that Mojang is burdened to continually provide for you. For online games like Fortnite that are actually hosted by the company, that would be correct. But Minecraft isn't like that, it's merely a product that you buy, then download and use yourself. Your use of it afterwards only affects you, thus they should not be trying to dictate it (and you should also not be trying to control other users).\n\nOk so let's say, theoretically, I hosted a Minecraft server that downloaded malware to your computer every time you connected and Mojang found out, you would actually argue that the server should be allowed to stay up? Would it be \"tyranny\" to not allow the server operator to infect people's devices with malware? \n\n> That's a faulty analogy for two reasons.

That seems like a double-standard.\n\n> And that's beside the point, because you're actually arguing that you should be in charge of what other people who spent the same money should do.\n\nAgain I've debunked this argument, the server software is free, these P2W operators paid nothing to use it.\n\n> If they're hosting it all themselves, without Mojang's help, it's kind of u","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>There shouldn't be rules for how you're allowed to use something you bought in the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me you don't dislike tyranny, you dislike the existence of rules period.

Because you seem to conflate the existence of rules as tyranny when in reality tyranny is defined as \"cruel and oppressive government or rule\" and I would not consider telling cancer to stop being cancer as cruel, and last time I checked Mojang isn't a government they're a private entity. If Mojang wanted to be tyrannical they'd force server owners to pay a license fee to host Minecraft servers (when in fact you don't even need to own the game to run a server, you can straight up download the server jar for free) or go after 2B2T.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, they shouldn't be banning people at all, nor should they be shutting down servers they don't like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wait wait wait hold on here, so you're saying that a private server operator should be disallowed from banning someone from his own server? Ok so they can host P2W, but not ban users who disrupt the server?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to do something in a world, does Mojang have to do it for you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it's an issue involving Minecraft, ummmm yes they do since it's their product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course not, and likewise they shouldn't have to manage your server for you either. As for accounts, you're likening it to an account on a website when in reality it's little more than a way to purchase the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They're not managing servers, they're enforcing the license agreement that these server operators agreed to. Also, it's actually a bit more than \"just a way to purchase the game\" it's actually an integral part of Minecraft multiplayer and pretty much always has been. Even before Microsoft bought Minecraft if you were not authenticated to your Mojang account you were not going to be connecting to any servers unless they disabled the authentication which some such as the Meloncraft example someone else brought up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Didn't know we were talking about alts, which I don't recall not being allowed, but anyway this is a problem that's practically impossible to solve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stop being dishonest, we're talking about the sale of accounts which is primarily used to enable alt accounting. Hell there's even 3rd party launchers that connect to a service where you can swap alts on the fly specifically for server ban-evasion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mojang can do little more than the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well other than ban the account, which again is their right as per the agreement you made with them when you purchased their software.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you can see on any website, the only solution is IP or machine address banning, things that are so easily manipulated that even intelligence agencies can't trace them, and IP bans are already available to servers.

Eventually they'll get tired of it, and in the case of Minecraft it's at least a little easier since they'd soon not want to keep paying for new alts all the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lmao, yeaaaaaaah you don't know how that works if you think they are going to get bored. I would hope you would know that some people take their block game very seriously.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I highly doubt that there would be a scenario where every single server became P2W. Even if most of them did, there are still thousands of servers just being made for fun which are unlikely to ever have that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah a server between friends is totally the same as Mineplex, Hypixel, etc etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you think they'd just come out and say it immediately? No, that would be suicide. They want to phase it out slowly so less people notice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They won't do it ever, and even if they did start we'd have years of notice specifically for the server issue I mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That's part of a deeper MS plan.

It's the exact same crap Apple does all the time with its Mac-only software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, no. Microsoft for whatever true intention has been decoupling themselves more and more from Windows 10.

I would not call your edition that gets updates first second-priority. Actually in fact they redid Bedrock's version numbers to line up with Java's, not the other way around. If Java was really playing second fiddle why not the other way around?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They renamed Bedrock to just \"Minecraft\" and slapped \"Java Edition\" (which many will read as \"slow and buggy edition\") onto the original. They literally admitted that they are now treating Bedrock as <em>the</em> Minecraft, and making everyone use a MS account is another step towards phasing out the original.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Except they can't just switch you to Bedrock. It's not a simple toggle where \"Oh now your Java is getting updated to Bedrock now\" and never will be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wrong. There used to be plenty of different console and mobile editions that all got merged with Bedrock. There's no reason to think they can't do this again, except that they need to do it more slowly so people don't react all at once.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The process would take years as servers would have to switch over, maintain legacy instances for Java players, and it would be an entire clusterfuck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you really think Microsoft cares? They probably would have a decade ago, but now they've followed in Apple's footsteps and only care about the 5-year-olds wanting to buy that ingame merch that would've been a freely available mod or texture pack or skin on Java.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What can you do on Java for free that's paid on Bedrock?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most glaringly, mods. Yes Bedrock mods exist but they're very limited and I believe it's also illegal. I'm not as sure on this one but I remember hearing that custom skins and texture packs are also forbidden for Bedrock.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3rd parties that agreed to a set of rules when they decided to download and run the software. So you're saying Mojang has no rights to their private property (their software)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, this is a ridiculous white knight argument. There's some stupid law that the US reluctantly accepted from international organizations that says Mojang is allowed to completely control everything users do with what they bought from them, so that must mean absolutely everything they do is right and they can do no wrong and you're not allowed to ever disagree with it.</p>\n<p>You seem to be thinking of Minecraft as a service that Mojang is burdened to continually provide for you. For online games like Fortnite that are actually hosted by the company, that would be correct. But Minecraft isn't like that, it's merely a product that you buy, then download and use yourself. Your use of it afterwards only affects you, thus they should not be trying to dictate it (and you should also not be trying to control other users).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I rent a car, can I just throw the agreement I signed out the window and go drag racing with it because I am a 3rd party?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's a faulty analogy for two reasons. Of course you can't go drag racing with someone else's car because it will destroy their car. But they shouldn't be able to stop you from buying another one of the same car for yourself and going drag racing with it, however foolish that would be. The second problem with that analogy is, Minecraft isn't a rent like more and more software is becoming anymore, you own it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So you're saying that if I pay for a piece of software, I should just shut the fuck up and offer no input on how the money I paid is spent or used?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, but you can't force them to listen to you. And that's beside the point, because you're actually arguing that you should be in charge of what other people who spent the same money should do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If these servers want to be P2W, why don't they just make their own game and it can be as P2W as they want it to be! Why is it that you only apply that logic one way? Why can't that same logic apply to these P2W server operators who got BTFO'd by the rules they agreed to when they decided to host Minecraft</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If they're hosting it all themselves, without Mojang's help, it's kind of unfair for Mojang to control them. That's like passing a law forcing all websites to censor \"hate speech\".</p>\n","created_utc":1603757966,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_ews0","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/minecraft/banner-5.png","color":"#34AA2F","created_utc":1581736139,"description":"A guild dedicated to Minecraft!

There is zero proof that they're going to kill Java as that would basically be suicide for the game as that's where all the servers and community live.\r\n\r\nThere has been signs of it for a long time. It's already been second-priority for years now, as evidenced by the name changes. And the next step is forcing everyone onto a Microsoft account, so that it's easier for them to switch you to Bedrock Edition in the future.

Do you go around screaming TYRANNY!!11!!1 when you walk into Walmart naked and the manager tells you to put some clothes on?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's a faulty analogy. It would be more like having someone else host your server. So for example it would be fine if they banned this activity on Minecraft Realms (though still petty), but not when they try to control privately run servers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also this is a private company doing this, blocking these P2W servers, would you much rather a government entity step in to police Minecraft or would you rather the developers self-police their own fucking software to an extent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why should private affairs be policed this way at all?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Almost like selling accounts is most often used for ban evasion or something and this is likely something server operators (remember, you were just defending these people when they wanted to do P2W so you can't go back and criticize them now) asked them to add to the EULA being that they are a large part of the pull that gets people playing Minecraft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well that's their own problem. If you break the rules on reddit, is anyone but reddit responsible for stopping you? Likewise, if these people decide to run a server and can't enforce their rules, it's their responsibility, and it's just ridiculous to pin the blame on Mojang like that. Kind of like how society is too overprotective these days because if something happens it's always someone else's fault, so they have to make sure it doesn't even come close to happening (kids are being stupid? It's the teachers and parents fault. Had an accident and got hurt somewhere? It's the landowners fault. People are offending each other? It's the government's responsibility).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ok, right now start up a successful server with minigames, a shop/auction system, anti-cheat, a catchy innovative feature to get people interested, and powerful enough hardware/a fast enough internet connection to handle all of those members joining then give me the address to connect to it. Hop to it since it's supposedly so super easy that anyone can do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn't say it was easy, but very few things are. You have to choose your battles. If you want such a server, and can start one, it's partially your fault that it doesn't exist. Plus, you're still wrong that no non-P2W servers exist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How is Microsoft forcing you off of PC, Android, and Xbox editions of Bedrock?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They're not, they're just trying to get everyone off of non-Bedrock editions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually above that how are they forcing you off of Java? There is zero proof that they're going to kill Java as that would basically be suicide for the game as that's where all the servers and community live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There has been signs of it for a long time. It's already been second-priority for years now, as evidenced by the name changes. And the next step is forcing everyone onto a Microsoft account, so that it's easier for them to switch you to Bedrock Edition in the future. They can also ban you more easily and control your gameplay more. On top of that, it makes sense why they want to do this: they have more control over Bedrock and there are lots of things you can do for free on Java that they make you pay for on Bedrock.
