That helps me with picking the right colors, and you're definitely not a failure if you're struggling with this. I remember a personal project I worked on years ago, where I was completely clueless on how to pick the correct colors. \r\n\r\nI will summarize what the color picker does and how to use it to its full extent, so you can pick better colors. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/03yKRqn.png\r\n\r\n**Transparency**\r\n\r\nThis is color picker you're probably working with. At the very bottom, you can see the transparency scale. This isn't relevant for what we're working with, so ignore it. \r\n\r\n**Hue**\r\n\r\nAbove the transparency scale, you can see the hue scale. Hue is essentially a fancy word for color. This is where you should always start when you want to pick colors. It shows the full rainbow of colors.\r\n\r\n**Brightness**\r\n\r\nThis where many people can get confused by the color picker. The brightest things are at the top, and the darkest are at the bottom. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/D8kMObA.png\r\n\r\n**Saturation**\r\n\r\nHere's how Wikipedia describes saturation:\r\n\r\n>Chroma [saturation, purity, strength, intensity] (intense vs. dull)\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Traditional_color_theory\r\n\r\nIt is essentially how grey a color is. That is of course an oversimplification, but fairly accurate. The further left you go on the color picker, the more grey looking your color will be. At the very top of the color picker, the further you go left, the more white it will look. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6DVlpxX.png\r\n\r\n**How this can be used for a triangle compass**\r\n\r\nThe middle triangle, in my triangle compass template, had zero saturation and some brightness. This is grey, meant to represent centrists. AuthLeft had a pure red hue, with some brightness and some saturation. \r\n\r\nWhen a triangle is closer to the center, I made it have less saturation. When it was closer to the edge of the triangle, I made it have a lot of saturation. The outside of the triangle was essentially gradients between pure LibRight, pure AuthLeft, and pure AuthRight. The inside was those same gradients, but with much less saturation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>This is a common theme in my life. Whenever I try to do something, it's an embarrassing mess and obvious that I just threw it together. Whenever anyone else tries to do something, it's 100% perfect and could be used in a professional industry environment, usually with less effort and time than my crap took.\r\n\r\nDon't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you're skilled in something. List some of your hobbies, and I guarantee you I'm terrible at them and you're better than me. You showed me some stuff you did in Photoshop, and it looks better than anything I ever made in GIMP.\r\n\r\nAnd this isn't very relevant, but I'm also terrible at any action video games I play, but I don't let that ruin my enjoyment of them. That also doesn't define my video game experience, I would consider myself extremely good at Run 3 (A flash platforming game, but still very fun. I can easily beat the hardest levels there.), and I'm pretty decent at platforming and strategy games. \r\n\r\n>Everything I try to do ends up like this and the simple explanation is probably that I'm just a complete failure of a person.\r\n\r\nI'm certain that's not true. It takes practice, time, and effort to get good at something. One of my hobbies is creating pixel art, and I was garbage at it when I started. It looked literally disgusting. I've practiced a lot, and I can see the difference that has made. You can't expect to be great at everything the first time you do it.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, how long did you spend on the triangle template you made? I spend a lot of time getting my triangle template to look good. It didn't take like 5 minutes or anything, maybe 20-30. I spent a lot of time lining up the shapes and getting all the colors just right, not to mentioned I have large amounts of experience in Google Drawings and I know basically all of its functionality.","body_html":"<p>I studied basic color theory and I work in graphic design.

At the very top of the color picker, the further you go left, the more white it will look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/6DVlpxX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/6DVlpxX.png</a></p>\n<p><strong>How this can be used for a triangle compass</strong></p>\n<p>The middle triangle, in my triangle compass template, had zero saturation and some brightness. This is grey, meant to represent centrists. AuthLeft had a pure red hue, with some brightness and some saturation.</p>\n<p>When a triangle is closer to the center, I made it have less saturation. When it was closer to the edge of the triangle, I made it have a lot of saturation. The outside of the triangle was essentially gradients between pure LibRight, pure AuthLeft, and pure AuthRight. The inside was those same gradients, but with much less saturation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a common theme in my life. Whenever I try to do something, it's an embarrassing mess and obvious that I just threw it together. Whenever anyone else tries to do something, it's 100% perfect and could be used in a professional industry environment, usually with less effort and time than my crap took.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you're skilled in something. List some of your hobbies, and I guarantee you I'm terrible at them and you're better than me. You showed me some stuff you did in Photoshop, and it looks better than anything I ever made in GIMP.</p>\n<p>And this isn't very relevant, but I'm also terrible at any action video games I play, but I don't let that ruin my enjoyment of them. That also doesn't define my video game experience, I would consider myself extremely good at Run 3 (A flash platforming game, but still very fun. I can easily beat the hardest levels there.), and I'm pretty decent at platforming and strategy games.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything I try to do ends up like this and the simple explanation is probably that I'm just a complete failure of a person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm certain that's not true. It takes practice, time, and effort to get good at something. One of my hobbies is creating pixel art, and I was garbage at it when I started. It looked literally disgusting. I've practiced a lot, and I can see the difference that has made. You can't expect to be great at everything the first time you do it.</p>\n<p>And by the way, how long did you spend on the triangle template you made? I spend a lot of time getting my triangle template to look good. It didn't take like 5 minutes or anything, maybe 20-30. I spent a lot of time lining up the shapes and getting all the colors just right, not to mentioned I have large amounts of experience in Google Drawings and I know basically all of its functionality.</p>\n","created_utc":1602694841,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_dtet","guild_id":"32f","herald_guild":null,"id":"dtet","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":4,"parent_comment_id":["dsp8"],"permalink":"/+PoliticalTriangleMemes/post/3nhl/template-for-anyone-who-wants-to/dtet","post_id":"3nhl","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["dtet"],"permalink":"/+PoliticalTriangleMemes/post/3nhl/template-for-anyone-who-wants-to/dthv","post":{"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":12,"created_utc":1601438312,"domain":"i.imgur.com","downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_3nhl","guild_id":"32f","guild_name":"PoliticalTriangleMemes","herald_guild":null,"id":"3nhl","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":true,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+PoliticalTriangleMemes/post/3nhl/template-for-anyone-who-wants-to","score":20,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/3nhl/thumb.png","title":"Template for anyone who wants to make a large Wojak compass meme.","upvotes":22,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/0XMBXcG.png"},"post_id":"3nhl","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
