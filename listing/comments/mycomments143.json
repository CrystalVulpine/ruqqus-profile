I don't know lol. kek said this a few months ago on the discord: \"Breaker of Ruqqus is earned when you find a bug that causes Ruqqus to crash\", while someone else said that the admins sometimes award it for really trivial things. It seems that Seq37 is quite obsessed with trying to breaking ruqqus, so maybe you can ask him about it.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/post/3un4/10-badges-an-absolute-record\">I recently found out from this post that some badges are clickable</a>.

(eg. a class of a flair would be something like \"Row-2-Col-3\", and they'd have css like `.flair[class*=\"Row-2\"]{background-position-x: 50px;}`) One place where I saw this was /r/vexillology. Another place where I saw something like this was actually [/r/mylittlepony of all subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/wiki/emote_guide). (It's somewhat similar. For example, you can add \"-in\" for an inline emote, and you can add \"r\" to flip an emote.)\r\n\r\n>You also seem to know how to access specific children and the entire DOM tree with CSS.

I basically looked at what tricks other subreddits used and tried to remember them, then looked at a CSS reference ([this one to be specific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)) to see if there was anything else I could use, and I also used Google. (The results that I look at are usually the ones from sites like CSS tricks or Stack Overflow. I think you've mentioned before that you usually can't find good results. I don't remember what I've searched for before, but sometimes the results are useful, sometimes they're not, and I unfortunately don't know how to get better ones.)\r\n\r\n>Also, where did you learn to access a user overview in a subreddit (/r/subreddit/user/username)?\r\n\r\n[By complete accident: I was on PCM and decided to visit 1RedReddit's profile by typing \"/user/1RedReddit\" into the url, but I forgot to delete the \"/r/PoliticalCompassMemes\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/comments/gd36fc/hello_everyone_if_theres_anything_interesting/fqvgrxf/).","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Know to use \"invisible\" hrefs to mark text</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel that this actually is kind of similar to styling regular links like /r/PartyParrot did. The only difference here is that the element being styled is the one directly after the link. (I decided to do it this way rather than styling the links themselves because I didn't want the formatted text to continue acting as links. The alternative is to style the links and add \"pointer-events: none\", but then the cursor would be wrong.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know to use href titles, and how to use them in markdown (I've never seen it before)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I saw that in a markdown reference page. <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/wiki/markdown#wiki_links\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I think the one on reddit mentions it</a>. I've seem other subreddits select links based on their hrefs (also in subreddits with CSS emojis), but I decided to use titles because I liked them better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you can't just select letters or words</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah. That's why it selects elements, not words. (So I'd write <code>[](#nxt \"red\")*Red*</code>, not just <code>[](#nxt \"red\")Red</code>.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know how to dynamically combine different CSS selectors and properties based on \"codes\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Sorry, I wasn't entirely sure what you meant by this)</p>\n<p>If I'm interpreting this correctly, I've seen other subreddits do this before when styling flairs and their CSS emotes.

However, there's a trick to it: When running a normal search and hopping to the \"News\" tab, there are some options in the \"Tools\" menu that let you filter and sort stories by date rather than \"relevance\". All of a sudden you get to see smaller sites reporting on stories which the rest of the media refuse to cover, such as vote fraud at the moment. The normal algo will never show you it at all.</p>\n","created_utc":1602271583,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_dejq","guild_id":"1v","herald_guild":null,"id":"dejq","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/3wkw/how-do-you-all-still-find/dejq","post_id":"3wkw","score":9,"upvotes":9,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["dejq"],"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/3wkw/how-do-you-all-still-find/deyq","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"We all know that for a while, search engines (most famously Google) have started changing their algorithm to promote the content they want you to see, which makes it extremely hard to find what you're looking for.
