I created <a href=\"/+foxes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+foxes/pic/profile\"/>+foxes</a>, and have trouble finding enough content because I can only search google images, reddit, and imgur. However, many posters could easily find multiple pics or videos from a variety of buried social media posts and extremely-little-known websites. They do this from tons of different sources, all the time.</p>\n<p>Another example is news stories. Everyone except me can find about 100 cool news stories (or politicians' comments) per hour the nanosecond they come out, just by \"looking\" for them. Well I also look for them, and only ever find the very top, trending stories, that everyone has already seen. There is no way to find anything else other than pure luck, so I don't know what kind of magic you all are using.</p>\n<p>So, search engines are basically useless now. So how does everyone still find everything online, and why does everyone always try to sidestep that question when I ask them (as if I'm not supposed to know for some reason)?</p>\n","comment_count":57,"created_utc":1602265866,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_3wkw","guild_id":"1v","guild_name":"AskRuqqus","herald_guild":null,"id":"3wkw","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/3wkw/how-do-you-all-still-find","score":65,"thumb_url":null,"title":"How do you all still find everything on the internet even though search engines suck now?","upvotes":64,"url":""},"post_id":"3wkw","score":8,"upvotes":8,"voted":0}

I don't use the Ruqqus Discord at all, so I'm sort of out of the loop when it comes to things like this.\r\n\r\nBasically there's a couple of users the admins just decided are their divine golden children. Most of my friends here are in that group, but the admins *hate* me, which makes it a bit personal for me. But in any case:\r\n\r\n* They absolutely refuse to allow active members of the discord who are interested in modding it become mods. The current mods were just straight up invited by the admins when they decided to add mods. They just picked who they liked and are very exclusive about who's good enough to work with them. Basically, if they didn't ask you, you're out. They always say \"we don't need any more mods\". The only exception was that they did have mod apps at one point, but they decided to get rid of it almost immediately and only let *two* new mods on the team, who were of course also some of their favorite users. So basically, the mod application was a scam to \"prove\" that they're being fair about it.\r\n\r\nThe discord mod thing, however, is merely a symptom of a much greater problem. The admins show this favoritism elsewhere too. The badges were one example, but also:\r\n\r\n* Who are the GMs of guilds that the admins run (+WatchRedditDie, +BetaFeedback, +Technology, a few others I can't remember)? You guessed it! Most of these were appointed before becoming discord mods...so it proves that the admins were already biased towards them when they were added. The admins are also very exclusive about who's allowed to GM stuff with them, but it took zero effort for the current ones to be invited.\r\n\r\n* Whenever anyone else creates a meta-guild, the admins make sure to brush it off because they're not good enough for that in their eyes.\r\n\r\n* The admins pretty much create whatever channels the mods want in the discord server\r\n\r\n* The admins always make sure to award earned roles to mods and soon-to-be-mods in the discord server, but others rarely get them.\r\n\r\n* They give the mods more than just moderating privileges on the discord, including: the right to see deleted channels, the right to send messages in channels without earning the required roles, the right to see deleted and even edit versions of messages (security risk), access to private logs detailing the admins' actions, a private chat with the admins where they are told about things the rest of us aren't, the right to bypass slowmode filters, banned words, etc, and I'm sure a lot more stuff. This is intentional, and they see it fit because the mods apparently deserve more than others because of their status.\r\n\r\n* The admins become *extremely angry and defensive* when you dare criticize this holy caste system of theirs. And I mean they get fucking triggered, at least cap and ark. They even removed the reddit nazi reaction from the server because I used it to call them out on this.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>it increases the potential for AHStards trying to infiltrate the guild and also makes it more likely some kind of vandalism will occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So do elections.

I don't use the Ruqqus Discord at all, so I'm sort of out of the loop when it comes to things like this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically there's a couple of users the admins just decided are their divine golden children. Most of my friends here are in that group, but the admins <em>hate</em> me, which makes it a bit personal for me. But in any case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They absolutely refuse to allow active members of the discord who are interested in modding it become mods. The current mods were just straight up invited by the admins when they decided to add mods. They just picked who they liked and are very exclusive about who's good enough to work with them. Basically, if they didn't ask you, you're out. They always say \"we don't need any more mods\". The only exception was that they did have mod apps at one point, but they decided to get rid of it almost immediately and only let <em>two</em> new mods on the team, who were of course also some of their favorite users. So basically, the mod application was a scam to \"prove\" that they're being fair about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The discord mod thing, however, is merely a symptom of a much greater problem. The admins show this favoritism elsewhere too. The badges were one example, but also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Who are the GMs of guilds that the admins run (+WatchRedditDie, <a href=\"/+BetaFeedback\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BetaFeedback/pic/profile\"/>+BetaFeedback</a>, <a href=\"/+Technology\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Technology/pic/profile\"/>+Technology</a>, a few others I can't remember)? You guessed it! Most of these were appointed before becoming discord mods...so it proves that the admins were already biased towards them when they were added. The admins are also very exclusive about who's allowed to GM stuff with them, but it took zero effort for the current ones to be invited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whenever anyone else creates a meta-guild, the admins make sure to brush it off because they're not good enough for that in their eyes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins pretty much create whatever channels the mods want in the discord server</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins always make sure to award earned roles to mods and soon-to-be-mods in the discord server, but others rarely get them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They give the mods more than just moderating privileges on the discord, including: the right to see deleted channels, the right to send messages in channels without earning the required roles, the right to see deleted and even edit versions of messages (security risk), access to private logs detailing the admins' actions, a private chat with the admins where they are told about things the rest of us aren't, the right to bypass slowmode filters, banned words, etc, and I'm sure a lot more stuff. This is intentional, and they see it fit because the mods apparently deserve more than others because of their status.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins become <em>extremely angry and defensive</em> when you dare criticize this holy caste system of theirs. And I mean they get fucking triggered, at least cap and ark. They even removed the reddit nazi reaction from the server because I used it to call them out on this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","created_utc":1602175391,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_dafp","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1575480088,"description":"The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nüíª No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\nüü™ Ruqqus-related only.
