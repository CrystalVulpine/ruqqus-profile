Instead, guild treasuries should be able to mint their own rep currencies which can be earned and spent in the Ruqqus marketplaces of ideas. Users and guildmasters should be able to sort, filter, boost & auto-moderate their feeds based on other users’ net worths, and based on the current market value of posts, using whichever currencies they choose to consider valuable - if any.\r\n\r\n> Content warning: extremely long\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nThe traditional discussion forum is unfit for purpose in the age of information warfare and ideological polarisation. Although Reddit suffered from corrupt admins who would ban communities and parachute sympathetic mods into hostile subs, these are not essential ingredients for a forum takeover - especially on a site like Ruqqus that is committed to neutrality and free speech, which can’t just ban people for being annoying, extremist, or a bit retarded. \r\n\r\nWhatever tweaks to the forum format the Ruqqus devs make, a determined mob could still subvert the culture, driving away the established community. A larger army of sock-puppets and meat-puppets could defeat guild moderators in a war of attrition; burying legitimate content with their votes and flooding posts with derailing comments. Exiled saboteurs could just come back with a new account. Defensively making guilds private or excluded from /all would kill their growth as no-one would stumble upon them any more.\r\n\r\n#### Ruqqus is vulnerable\r\nThe only thing protecting Ruqqus at present is its relative obscurity: as soon as the site appears on the radars of well organised political extremists, it becomes a numbers game that the old guard is likely to lose.\r\n\r\nEven if options are added to allow users to sort & filter based on other users’ reputation, and to allow guildmasters to apply reputation thresholds to users who would join their guilds, requiring a certain amount of rep before users are allowed to make posts or vote on comments; this would still inevitably lead to a site-wide monoculture where a feedback loop would cause one ideology to define what’s reputable and what’s not. Again, the whole system of reputation could be hijacked by outsiders who wish to destroy the community - we’ve already seen this start to happen with incidents of brigading.\r\n\r\n#### A universal system of reputation cannot remain neutral\r\nIn this day and age, a site using a traditional reddit-like format cannot remain neutral - it will inevitably become a battleground where one viewpoint drives others away. For a site like this to be resilient to invasions and to be a place where multiple ideologies can exist in the same space, we need more than one market for ideas. We need multiple, parallel meme economies.\r\n\r\n### The solution: Guild Treasuries\r\nMy suggestion is that guilds should be able to mint their own currencies, which are similar to reputation points except they can be passed on from user to user when they upvote a post or a comment (this can take place on any post in any guild - not just where the currency is minted). Just like real fiat currencies, guild currencies have no inherent value and affect nothing unless a user chooses to voluntarily respect the currency by allowing it to affect their filters. Users can adjust each currency’s influence on their feed - so if they’re sick of seeing political posts one day they can just slide their political currency weights down to 0 for a while.\r\n\r\n#### Treasure\r\nWhen voting on a post or comment a user “spends” their currency, and in return they get to claim “ownership” of the post - that is, it becomes their treasure which they can exhibit in their personal treasure trove on their profile page. The value of a user’s treasure is adjusted for inflation and counts towards their net worth. This mechanic is to deter hoarding of currency and so that the system more closely mimics a real economic system. That is: users need to get something in return for their spending.\r\n\r\nRuqqians then become like art collectors who enjoy the prestige of building up a collection of fine memes and notable commentary that they have bought on the open meme market. The user who bid the most on a given post / comment wins ownership of the original piece, while other users who bid less get issued with a lesser “reproduction” that they can exhibit in their treasure trove should they wish to curate a gallery full of Ruqqus’s finest moments, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n#### Treasurers\r\nWhen a guild mints a new currency, the guildmaster designates certain users as “treasurers”. These are users who are trusted by the guild and who publish a manifesto stating the criteria by which they will reward other users, and in doing so they define what the currency represents. Treasurers effectively print money every time they vote, thus devaluing the currency and encouraging Ruqqians to spend their acquired balance sooner rather than later. Treasurer votes are public so that the market can see if they are being faithful to their manifestos, or if they are trying to subvert the market nefariously.\r\n\r\nSome possible currencies and manifestos might be:\r\n\r\nZingoleans\r\n- I promise to lavish Zingoleans generously upon any user who proves themselves competent in the martial art of witty insults\r\n\r\nSkullpieces\r\n- The +MindBlown mods will reward strangers who dramatically challenge our preconceptions with our guild currency: Skullpieces\r\n\r\nReichsmarks\r\n- I will give Reichsmarks to anyone exposing “coincidences”\r\n\r\nDust\r\n- I will reward those who glorify the dear leader Kim Il Sung with a delicious bag of Dust\r\n\r\nRep\r\n- The original Ruqqus reputation points, converted into an ordinary currency when markets first open\r\n\r\nThe economies of Ruqqus\r\nWith this system established, the site admins could present new users at signup with a list of the major economies of Ruqqus, allowing them to choose a left-leaning experience, a right-leaning one, a frenly one, a combative one, a funny one; etc., they could customise their frontpage by opting into whatever currencies sound appealing; or they could choose none at all: instead enjoying the pure, unfiltered ruqqus experience. \r\n\r\nThe different economies would exist in the same space, mostly living-and-letting-live, but still able to come together for healthy debates in neutral guilds - something that’s not possible if different schools of thought all hang out on completely different websites. Something that’s not possible when a site like Reddit, Ruqqus or Voat becomes a monoculture.\r\n\r\n#### Market subversion\r\nIt’s possible that hoarders and wealthy elites could eventually take control of a given market or even a whole economy, in order to maliciously filter what users get to read, similar to what has happened with Reddit and its admins who deviously control the algorithm. It’s also possible that people could get locked inside an unhealthy filter bubble, like with *<name literally any chat forum or community on the internet today>*. \r\n\r\nThe benefit of a system of multiple, parallel meme economies is that users can simply ditch a currency whose market has become corrupt or toxic, by removing it from their filters. This is far less disruptive than users having to ditch an entire website; migrating from site to site like information refugees and watching the same pattern repeat over and over again. Instead, just throw your sack of Zingoleans down a well and start collecting something else instead. You’ll still have your treasure - but all that effort the trolls expended capturing the market will have been for nothing when users notice the shenanigans and all just opt out.\r\n\r\n### Things I’m not sure about\r\n\r\n- Ability to buy and sell treasure after acquisition. This could allow markets to be suddenly cornered and subverted by someone selling all their treasure at once, and then voting against the currency’s intended purpose. I’m not sure if treasure trading is desirable - but it could be fun from a meme collector point of view.\r\n\r\n- Currency trading. This could also be fun, but allowing currencies to be exchanged would effectively mean there is one universal reputation system again and I don’t think it’s a good idea. Instead of using exchange rates to judge the relative values of currencies, this could be measured by comparing the number of users and guilds who are actively using the currencies in their filters.\r\n\r\n- Taxation. I think there needs to be a factor which diminishes currency on every trade - otherwise 2 people could just keep voting back-and-forth on each others’ posts, “creating value” from garbage, and maxing out their net worths artificially. Guilds and / or treasuries should probably be able to set e.g. a 10% tax rate which gets returned to the guild or treasury to prevent this. The lower the tax rate the more open to abuse a currency is, but the greater the power the community would have to influence the meaning of the currency.\r\n\r\n- Cursed currencies. Say you want to create a currency to mark people as retarded in some way, so you can keep them out of your guild. Your treasury “curses” the retarded user with 1000 Retarderinos. Now the retard has 1000 Rs they can inflict on other, non-retarded users. So perhaps it should be possible for innocent users to return cursed currency to the treasury - pending the treasury’s approval.\r\n\r\nOr: perhaps cursed treasuries could set a 100% tax rate so that the retarded user won’t have any Retardinos left to inflict on others. Or, maybe there just shouldn’t be any cursed currencies 🤷🏽‍♂️.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhile the markets are functioning correctly, the whole site will effectively self-moderate, and guildmasters need only appoint & sack treasurers, and set their guild thresholds. Nothing needs censoring and no-one needs banning. The invisible hand of the meme market takes care of everything.","body_html":"<p>tl;dr: Reputation shouldn’t be universal.

Instead, guild treasuries should be able to mint their own rep currencies which can be earned and spent in the Ruqqus marketplaces of ideas. Users and guildmasters should be able to sort, filter, boost & auto-moderate their feeds based on other users’ net worths, and based on the current market value of posts, using whichever currencies they choose to consider valuable - if any.\r\n\r\n> Content warning: extremely long\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nThe traditional discussion forum is unfit for purpose in the age of information warfare and ideological polarisation. Although Reddit suffered from corrupt admins who would ban communities and parachute sympathetic mods into hostile subs, these are not essential ingredients for a forum takeover - especially on a site like Ruqqus that is committed to neutrality and free speech, which can’t just ban people for being annoying, extremist, or a bit retarded. \r\n\r\nWhatever tweaks to the forum format the Ruqqus devs make, a determined mob could still subvert the culture, driving away the established community. A larger army of sock-puppets and meat-puppets could defeat guild moderators in a war of attrition; burying legitimate content with their votes and flooding posts with derailing comments. Exiled saboteurs could just come back with a new account. Defensively making guilds private or excluded from /all would kill their growth as no-one would stumble upon them any more.\r\n\r\n#### Ruqqus is vulnerable\r\nThe only thing protecting Ruqqus at present is its relative obscurity: as soon as the site appears on the radars of well organised political extremists, it becomes a numbers game that the old guard is likely to lose.\r\n\r\nEven if options are added to allow users to sort & filter based on other users’ reputation, and to allow guildmasters to apply reputation thresholds to users who would join their guilds, requiring a certain amount of rep before users are allowed to make posts or vote on comments; this would still inevitably lead to a site-wide monoculture where a feedback loop would cause one ideology to define what’s reputable and what’s not. Again, the whole system of reputation could be hijacked by outsiders who wish to destroy the community - we’ve already seen this start to happen with incidents of brigading.\r\n\r\n#### A universal system of reputation cannot remain neutral\r\nIn this day and age, a site using a traditional reddit-like format cannot remain neutral - it will inevitably become a battleground where one viewpoint drives others away. For a site like this to be resilient to invasions and to be a place where multiple ideologies can exist in the same space, we need more than one market for ideas. We need multiple, parallel meme economies.\r\n\r\n### The solution: Guild Treasuries\r\nMy suggestion is that guilds should be able to mint their own currencies, which are similar to reputation points except they can be passed on from user to user when they upvote a post or a comment (this can take place on any post in any guild - not just where the currency is minted). Just like real fiat currencies, guild currencies have no inherent value and affect nothing unless a user chooses to voluntarily respect the currency by allowing it to affect their filters. Users can adjust each currency’s influence on their feed - so if they’re sick of seeing political posts one day they can just slide their political currency weights down to 0 for a while.\r\n\r\n#### Treasure\r\nWhen voting on a post or comment a user “spends” their currency, and in return they get to claim “ownership” of the post - that is, it becomes their treasure which they can exhibit in their personal treasure trove on their profile page. The value of a user’s treasure is adjusted for inflation and counts towards their net worth. This mechanic is to deter hoarding of currency and so that the system more closely mimics a real economic system. That is: users need to get something in return for their spending.\r\n\r\nRuqqians then become like art collectors who enjoy the prestige of building up a collection of fine memes and notable commentary that they have bought on the open meme market. The user who bid the most on a given post / comment wins ownership of the original piece, while other users who bid less get issued with a lesser “reproduction” that they can exhibit in their treasure trove should they wish to curate a gallery full of Ruqqus’s finest moments, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n#### Treasurers\r\nWhen a guild mints a new currency, the guildmaster designates certain users as “treasurers”. These are users who are trusted by the guild and who publish a manifesto stating the criteria by which they will reward other users, and in doing so they define what the currency represents. Treasurers effectively print money every time they vote, thus devaluing the currency and encouraging Ruqqians to spend their acquired balance sooner rather than later. Treasurer votes are public so that the market can see if they are being faithful to their manifestos, or if they are trying to subvert the market nefariously.\r\n\r\nSome possible currencies and manifestos might be:\r\n\r\nZingoleans\r\n- I promise to lavish Zingoleans generously upon any user who proves themselves competent in the martial art of witty insults\r\n\r\nSkullpieces\r\n- The +MindBlown mods will reward strangers who dramatically challenge our preconceptions with our guild currency: Skullpieces\r\n\r\nReichsmarks\r\n- I will give Reichsmarks to anyone exposing “coincidences”\r\n\r\nDust\r\n- I will reward those who glorify the dear leader Kim Il Sung with a delicious bag of Dust\r\n\r\nRep\r\n- The original Ruqqus reputation points, converted into an ordinary currency when markets first open\r\n\r\nThe economies of Ruqqus\r\nWith this system established, the site admins could present new users at signup with a list of the major economies of Ruqqus, allowing them to choose a left-leaning experience, a right-leaning one, a frenly one, a combative one, a funny one; etc., they could customise their frontpage by opting into whatever currencies sound appealing; or they could choose none at all: instead enjoying the pure, unfiltered ruqqus experience. \r\n\r\nThe different economies would exist in the same space, mostly living-and-letting-live, but still able to come together for healthy debates in neutral guilds - something that’s not possible if different schools of thought all hang out on completely different websites. Something that’s not possible when a site like Reddit, Ruqqus or Voat becomes a monoculture.\r\n\r\n#### Market subversion\r\nIt’s possible that hoarders and wealthy elites could eventually take control of a given market or even a whole economy, in order to maliciously filter what users get to read, similar to what has happened with Reddit and its admins who deviously control the algorithm. It’s also possible that people could get locked inside an unhealthy filter bubble, like with *<name literally any chat forum or community on the internet today>*. \r\n\r\nThe benefit of a system of multiple, parallel meme economies is that users can simply ditch a currency whose market has become corrupt or toxic, by removing it from their filters. This is far less disruptive than users having to ditch an entire website; migrating from site to site like information refugees and watching the same pattern repeat over and over again. Instead, just throw your sack of Zingoleans down a well and start collecting something else instead. You’ll still have your treasure - but all that effort the trolls expended capturing the market will have been for nothing when users notice the shenanigans and all just opt out.\r\n\r\n### Things I’m not sure about\r\n\r\n- Ability to buy and sell treasure after acquisition. This could allow markets to be suddenly cornered and subverted by someone selling all their treasure at once, and then voting against the currency’s intended purpose. I’m not sure if treasure trading is desirable - but it could be fun from a meme collector point of view.\r\n\r\n- Currency trading. This could also be fun, but allowing currencies to be exchanged would effectively mean there is one universal reputation system again and I don’t think it’s a good idea. Instead of using exchange rates to judge the relative values of currencies, this could be measured by comparing the number of users and guilds who are actively using the currencies in their filters.\r\n\r\n- Taxation. I think there needs to be a factor which diminishes currency on every trade - otherwise 2 people could just keep voting back-and-forth on each others’ posts, “creating value” from garbage, and maxing out their net worths artificially. Guilds and / or treasuries should probably be able to set e.g. a 10% tax rate which gets returned to the guild or treasury to prevent this. The lower the tax rate the more open to abuse a currency is, but the greater the power the community would have to influence the meaning of the currency.\r\n\r\n- Cursed currencies. Say you want to create a currency to mark people as retarded in some way, so you can keep them out of your guild. Your treasury “curses” the retarded user with 1000 Retarderinos. Now the retard has 1000 Rs they can inflict on other, non-retarded users. So perhaps it should be possible for innocent users to return cursed currency to the treasury - pending the treasury’s approval.\r\n\r\nOr: perhaps cursed treasuries could set a 100% tax rate so that the retarded user won’t have any Retardinos left to inflict on others. Or, maybe there just shouldn’t be any cursed currencies 🤷🏽‍♂️.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhile the markets are functioning correctly, the whole site will effectively self-moderate, and guildmasters need only appoint & sack treasurers, and set their guild thresholds. Nothing needs censoring and no-one needs banning. The invisible hand of the meme market takes care of everything.","body_html":"<p>tl;dr: Reputation shouldn’t be universal.

Instead, guild treasuries should be able to mint their own rep currencies which can be earned and spent in the Ruqqus marketplaces of ideas. Users and guildmasters should be able to sort, filter, boost & auto-moderate their feeds based on other users’ net worths, and based on the current market value of posts, using whichever currencies they choose to consider valuable - if any.\r\n\r\n> Content warning: extremely long\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nThe traditional discussion forum is unfit for purpose in the age of information warfare and ideological polarisation. Although Reddit suffered from corrupt admins who would ban communities and parachute sympathetic mods into hostile subs, these are not essential ingredients for a forum takeover - especially on a site like Ruqqus that is committed to neutrality and free speech, which can’t just ban people for being annoying, extremist, or a bit retarded. \r\n\r\nWhatever tweaks to the forum format the Ruqqus devs make, a determined mob could still subvert the culture, driving away the established community. A larger army of sock-puppets and meat-puppets could defeat guild moderators in a war of attrition; burying legitimate content with their votes and flooding posts with derailing comments. Exiled saboteurs could just come back with a new account. Defensively making guilds private or excluded from /all would kill their growth as no-one would stumble upon them any more.\r\n\r\n#### Ruqqus is vulnerable\r\nThe only thing protecting Ruqqus at present is its relative obscurity: as soon as the site appears on the radars of well organised political extremists, it becomes a numbers game that the old guard is likely to lose.\r\n\r\nEven if options are added to allow users to sort & filter based on other users’ reputation, and to allow guildmasters to apply reputation thresholds to users who would join their guilds, requiring a certain amount of rep before users are allowed to make posts or vote on comments; this would still inevitably lead to a site-wide monoculture where a feedback loop would cause one ideology to define what’s reputable and what’s not. Again, the whole system of reputation could be hijacked by outsiders who wish to destroy the community - we’ve already seen this start to happen with incidents of brigading.\r\n\r\n#### A universal system of reputation cannot remain neutral\r\nIn this day and age, a site using a traditional reddit-like format cannot remain neutral - it will inevitably become a battleground where one viewpoint drives others away. For a site like this to be resilient to invasions and to be a place where multiple ideologies can exist in the same space, we need more than one market for ideas. We need multiple, parallel meme economies.\r\n\r\n### The solution: Guild Treasuries\r\nMy suggestion is that guilds should be able to mint their own currencies, which are similar to reputation points except they can be passed on from user to user when they upvote a post or a comment (this can take place on any post in any guild - not just where the currency is minted). Just like real fiat currencies, guild currencies have no inherent value and affect nothing unless a user chooses to voluntarily respect the currency by allowing it to affect their filters. Users can adjust each currency’s influence on their feed - so if they’re sick of seeing political posts one day they can just slide their political currency weights down to 0 for a while.\r\n\r\n#### Treasure\r\nWhen voting on a post or comment a user “spends” their currency, and in return they get to claim “ownership” of the post - that is, it becomes their treasure which they can exhibit in their personal treasure trove on their profile page. The value of a user’s treasure is adjusted for inflation and counts towards their net worth. This mechanic is to deter hoarding of currency and so that the system more closely mimics a real economic system. That is: users need to get something in return for their spending.\r\n\r\nRuqqians then become like art collectors who enjoy the prestige of building up a collection of fine memes and notable commentary that they have bought on the open meme market. The user who bid the most on a given post / comment wins ownership of the original piece, while other users who bid less get issued with a lesser “reproduction” that they can exhibit in their treasure trove should they wish to curate a gallery full of Ruqqus’s finest moments, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n#### Treasurers\r\nWhen a guild mints a new currency, the guildmaster designates certain users as “treasurers”. These are users who are trusted by the guild and who publish a manifesto stating the criteria by which they will reward other users, and in doing so they define what the currency represents. Treasurers effectively print money every time they vote, thus devaluing the currency and encouraging Ruqqians to spend their acquired balance sooner rather than later. Treasurer votes are public so that the market can see if they are being faithful to their manifestos, or if they are trying to subvert the market nefariously.\r\n\r\nSome possible currencies and manifestos might be:\r\n\r\nZingoleans\r\n- I promise to lavish Zingoleans generously upon any user who proves themselves competent in the martial art of witty insults\r\n\r\nSkullpieces\r\n- The +MindBlown mods will reward strangers who dramatically challenge our preconceptions with our guild currency: Skullpieces\r\n\r\nReichsmarks\r\n- I will give Reichsmarks to anyone exposing “coincidences”\r\n\r\nDust\r\n- I will reward those who glorify the dear leader Kim Il Sung with a delicious bag of Dust\r\n\r\nRep\r\n- The original Ruqqus reputation points, converted into an ordinary currency when markets first open\r\n\r\nThe economies of Ruqqus\r\nWith this system established, the site admins could present new users at signup with a list of the major economies of Ruqqus, allowing them to choose a left-leaning experience, a right-leaning one, a frenly one, a combative one, a funny one; etc., they could customise their frontpage by opting into whatever currencies sound appealing; or they could choose none at all: instead enjoying the pure, unfiltered ruqqus experience. \r\n\r\nThe different economies would exist in the same space, mostly living-and-letting-live, but still able to come together for healthy debates in neutral guilds - something that’s not possible if different schools of thought all hang out on completely different websites. Something that’s not possible when a site like Reddit, Ruqqus or Voat becomes a monoculture.\r\n\r\n#### Market subversion\r\nIt’s possible that hoarders and wealthy elites could eventually take control of a given market or even a whole economy, in order to maliciously filter what users get to read, similar to what has happened with Reddit and its admins who deviously control the algorithm. It’s also possible that people could get locked inside an unhealthy filter bubble, like with *<name literally any chat forum or community on the internet today>*. \r\n\r\nThe benefit of a system of multiple, parallel meme economies is that users can simply ditch a currency whose market has become corrupt or toxic, by removing it from their filters. This is far less disruptive than users having to ditch an entire website; migrating from site to site like information refugees and watching the same pattern repeat over and over again. Instead, just throw your sack of Zingoleans down a well and start collecting something else instead. You’ll still have your treasure - but all that effort the trolls expended capturing the market will have been for nothing when users notice the shenanigans and all just opt out.\r\n\r\n### Things I’m not sure about\r\n\r\n- Ability to buy and sell treasure after acquisition. This could allow markets to be suddenly cornered and subverted by someone selling all their treasure at once, and then voting against the currency’s intended purpose. I’m not sure if treasure trading is desirable - but it could be fun from a meme collector point of view.\r\n\r\n- Currency trading. This could also be fun, but allowing currencies to be exchanged would effectively mean there is one universal reputation system again and I don’t think it’s a good idea. Instead of using exchange rates to judge the relative values of currencies, this could be measured by comparing the number of users and guilds who are actively using the currencies in their filters.\r\n\r\n- Taxation. I think there needs to be a factor which diminishes currency on every trade - otherwise 2 people could just keep voting back-and-forth on each others’ posts, “creating value” from garbage, and maxing out their net worths artificially. Guilds and / or treasuries should probably be able to set e.g. a 10% tax rate which gets returned to the guild or treasury to prevent this. The lower the tax rate the more open to abuse a currency is, but the greater the power the community would have to influence the meaning of the currency.\r\n\r\n- Cursed currencies. Say you want to create a currency to mark people as retarded in some way, so you can keep them out of your guild. Your treasury “curses” the retarded user with 1000 Retarderinos. Now the retard has 1000 Rs they can inflict on other, non-retarded users. So perhaps it should be possible for innocent users to return cursed currency to the treasury - pending the treasury’s approval.\r\n\r\nOr: perhaps cursed treasuries could set a 100% tax rate so that the retarded user won’t have any Retardinos left to inflict on others. Or, maybe there just shouldn’t be any cursed currencies 🤷🏽‍♂️.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhile the markets are functioning correctly, the whole site will effectively self-moderate, and guildmasters need only appoint & sack treasurers, and set their guild thresholds. Nothing needs censoring and no-one needs banning. The invisible hand of the meme market takes care of everything.","body_html":"<p>tl;dr: Reputation shouldn’t be universal.

Instead, guild treasuries should be able to mint their own rep currencies which can be earned and spent in the Ruqqus marketplaces of ideas. Users and guildmasters should be able to sort, filter, boost & auto-moderate their feeds based on other users’ net worths, and based on the current market value of posts, using whichever currencies they choose to consider valuable - if any.\r\n\r\n> Content warning: extremely long\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nThe traditional discussion forum is unfit for purpose in the age of information warfare and ideological polarisation. Although Reddit suffered from corrupt admins who would ban communities and parachute sympathetic mods into hostile subs, these are not essential ingredients for a forum takeover - especially on a site like Ruqqus that is committed to neutrality and free speech, which can’t just ban people for being annoying, extremist, or a bit retarded. \r\n\r\nWhatever tweaks to the forum format the Ruqqus devs make, a determined mob could still subvert the culture, driving away the established community. A larger army of sock-puppets and meat-puppets could defeat guild moderators in a war of attrition; burying legitimate content with their votes and flooding posts with derailing comments. Exiled saboteurs could just come back with a new account. Defensively making guilds private or excluded from /all would kill their growth as no-one would stumble upon them any more.\r\n\r\n#### Ruqqus is vulnerable\r\nThe only thing protecting Ruqqus at present is its relative obscurity: as soon as the site appears on the radars of well organised political extremists, it becomes a numbers game that the old guard is likely to lose.\r\n\r\nEven if options are added to allow users to sort & filter based on other users’ reputation, and to allow guildmasters to apply reputation thresholds to users who would join their guilds, requiring a certain amount of rep before users are allowed to make posts or vote on comments; this would still inevitably lead to a site-wide monoculture where a feedback loop would cause one ideology to define what’s reputable and what’s not. Again, the whole system of reputation could be hijacked by outsiders who wish to destroy the community - we’ve already seen this start to happen with incidents of brigading.\r\n\r\n#### A universal system of reputation cannot remain neutral\r\nIn this day and age, a site using a traditional reddit-like format cannot remain neutral - it will inevitably become a battleground where one viewpoint drives others away. For a site like this to be resilient to invasions and to be a place where multiple ideologies can exist in the same space, we need more than one market for ideas. We need multiple, parallel meme economies.\r\n\r\n### The solution: Guild Treasuries\r\nMy suggestion is that guilds should be able to mint their own currencies, which are similar to reputation points except they can be passed on from user to user when they upvote a post or a comment (this can take place on any post in any guild - not just where the currency is minted). Just like real fiat currencies, guild currencies have no inherent value and affect nothing unless a user chooses to voluntarily respect the currency by allowing it to affect their filters. Users can adjust each currency’s influence on their feed - so if they’re sick of seeing political posts one day they can just slide their political currency weights down to 0 for a while.\r\n\r\n#### Treasure\r\nWhen voting on a post or comment a user “spends” their currency, and in return they get to claim “ownership” of the post - that is, it becomes their treasure which they can exhibit in their personal treasure trove on their profile page. The value of a user’s treasure is adjusted for inflation and counts towards their net worth. This mechanic is to deter hoarding of currency and so that the system more closely mimics a real economic system. That is: users need to get something in return for their spending.\r\n\r\nRuqqians then become like art collectors who enjoy the prestige of building up a collection of fine memes and notable commentary that they have bought on the open meme market. The user who bid the most on a given post / comment wins ownership of the original piece, while other users who bid less get issued with a lesser “reproduction” that they can exhibit in their treasure trove should they wish to curate a gallery full of Ruqqus’s finest moments, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n#### Treasurers\r\nWhen a guild mints a new currency, the guildmaster designates certain users as “treasurers”. These are users who are trusted by the guild and who publish a manifesto stating the criteria by which they will reward other users, and in doing so they define what the currency represents. Treasurers effectively print money every time they vote, thus devaluing the currency and encouraging Ruqqians to spend their acquired balance sooner rather than later. Treasurer votes are public so that the market can see if they are being faithful to their manifestos, or if they are trying to subvert the market nefariously.\r\n\r\nSome possible currencies and manifestos might be:\r\n\r\nZingoleans\r\n- I promise to lavish Zingoleans generously upon any user who proves themselves competent in the martial art of witty insults\r\n\r\nSkullpieces\r\n- The +MindBlown mods will reward strangers who dramatically challenge our preconceptions with our guild currency: Skullpieces\r\n\r\nReichsmarks\r\n- I will give Reichsmarks to anyone exposing “coincidences”\r\n\r\nDust\r\n- I will reward those who glorify the dear leader Kim Il Sung with a delicious bag of Dust\r\n\r\nRep\r\n- The original Ruqqus reputation points, converted into an ordinary currency when markets first open\r\n\r\nThe economies of Ruqqus\r\nWith this system established, the site admins could present new users at signup with a list of the major economies of Ruqqus, allowing them to choose a left-leaning experience, a right-leaning one, a frenly one, a combative one, a funny one; etc., they could customise their frontpage by opting into whatever currencies sound appealing; or they could choose none at all: instead enjoying the pure, unfiltered ruqqus experience. \r\n\r\nThe different economies would exist in the same space, mostly living-and-letting-live, but still able to come together for healthy debates in neutral guilds - something that’s not possible if different schools of thought all hang out on completely different websites. Something that’s not possible when a site like Reddit, Ruqqus or Voat becomes a monoculture.\r\n\r\n#### Market subversion\r\nIt’s possible that hoarders and wealthy elites could eventually take control of a given market or even a whole economy, in order to maliciously filter what users get to read, similar to what has happened with Reddit and its admins who deviously control the algorithm. It’s also possible that people could get locked inside an unhealthy filter bubble, like with *<name literally any chat forum or community on the internet today>*. \r\n\r\nThe benefit of a system of multiple, parallel meme economies is that users can simply ditch a currency whose market has become corrupt or toxic, by removing it from their filters. This is far less disruptive than users having to ditch an entire website; migrating from site to site like information refugees and watching the same pattern repeat over and over again. Instead, just throw your sack of Zingoleans down a well and start collecting something else instead. You’ll still have your treasure - but all that effort the trolls expended capturing the market will have been for nothing when users notice the shenanigans and all just opt out.\r\n\r\n### Things I’m not sure about\r\n\r\n- Ability to buy and sell treasure after acquisition. This could allow markets to be suddenly cornered and subverted by someone selling all their treasure at once, and then voting against the currency’s intended purpose. I’m not sure if treasure trading is desirable - but it could be fun from a meme collector point of view.\r\n\r\n- Currency trading. This could also be fun, but allowing currencies to be exchanged would effectively mean there is one universal reputation system again and I don’t think it’s a good idea. Instead of using exchange rates to judge the relative values of currencies, this could be measured by comparing the number of users and guilds who are actively using the currencies in their filters.\r\n\r\n- Taxation. I think there needs to be a factor which diminishes currency on every trade - otherwise 2 people could just keep voting back-and-forth on each others’ posts, “creating value” from garbage, and maxing out their net worths artificially. Guilds and / or treasuries should probably be able to set e.g. a 10% tax rate which gets returned to the guild or treasury to prevent this. The lower the tax rate the more open to abuse a currency is, but the greater the power the community would have to influence the meaning of the currency.\r\n\r\n- Cursed currencies. Say you want to create a currency to mark people as retarded in some way, so you can keep them out of your guild. Your treasury “curses” the retarded user with 1000 Retarderinos. Now the retard has 1000 Rs they can inflict on other, non-retarded users. So perhaps it should be possible for innocent users to return cursed currency to the treasury - pending the treasury’s approval.\r\n\r\nOr: perhaps cursed treasuries could set a 100% tax rate so that the retarded user won’t have any Retardinos left to inflict on others. Or, maybe there just shouldn’t be any cursed currencies 🤷🏽‍♂️.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhile the markets are functioning correctly, the whole site will effectively self-moderate, and guildmasters need only appoint & sack treasurers, and set their guild thresholds. Nothing needs censoring and no-one needs banning. The invisible hand of the meme market takes care of everything.","body_html":"<p>tl;dr: Reputation shouldn’t be universal.
