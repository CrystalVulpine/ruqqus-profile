It's literally idolatry. Apparently the mods are also allowed to break the rules of the server (though most don't), and the admins are 100% in support of that even though everyone else has to follow them strictly, and most of the users are on board with that setup too, and you can't even disagree with that without getting a ton of hate.

Every time it's brought up people in the server just dismiss it as either a \"lunatic conspiracy theory\" or \"it's not a big enough issue to fix\".

You disagree with one thing they do and everyone gives you so much shit for it. The general atmosphere from most users seems to be that the mods there are the gods of ruqqus or something who can do no wrong and everyone should follow them around all the time, and I think some of them are actually starting to believe in their own supposed inherent superiority and becoming prideful of it, which will not be good for avoiding power abuse. It's literally idolatry. Apparently the mods are also allowed to break the rules of the server (though most don't), and the admins are 100% in support of that even though everyone else has to follow them strictly, and most of the users are on board with that setup too, and you can't even disagree with that without getting a ton of hate. There are other things too, like admins seemingly showing favoritism towards certain users (who \"coincidentally\" all happen to have become mods of the discord server at some point), on both the main website and the discord server. Totally haven't seen that anywhere else before, have we?</p>\n<p>I don't see why the admins and especially the users are okay with having those kinds of double standards. Every time it's brought up people in the server just dismiss it as either a \"lunatic conspiracy theory\" or \"it's not a big enough issue to fix\".

I lost interest in everything I used to like and felt like I sucked at everything too. \r\n\r\nI’m in no way completely fixed now, but I think the biggest factor in helping me make peace with my life was tripping on psychedelics. Psilocybin mushrooms and LSD showed me that we live in a crazy, amazing world that has too much to offer for me to justify giving up on everything. I worked through a lot of things during those trips, and I think I’m a better person because of them. \r\n\r\nPsychedelics might not be for everyone, but I really do think they’re worth exploring. Recent research has been revealing how much even one dose can help with depression and other mental illnesses (though you don’t need to have a mental illness to see the benefits). \r\n\r\nI also think you should talk to your doctor about the way you’ve been feeling, and maybe even see a psychiatrist or psychologist. Prescribed antidepressants can help a lot too, if this really is depression. \r\n\r\nAlso I really liked the triangular political compass you made, enough to check out your profile here and look for other cool things you might’ve done. Even if you don’t think it’s impressive, it’s reached and affected a lot of people that do.
