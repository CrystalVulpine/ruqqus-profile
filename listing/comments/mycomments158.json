The ones that are creators had a drive their entire lives to develop a talent so they can get these ideas out of their heads and into the physical world, where they are consumed by the muggles.</p>\n<p>I recommend that you focus on whatever the one thing is you like the most.  I’ve been an animator for 30 years and I’ve hit plateaus, and gotten into ruts where I wasn’t learning, or even forgetting things I had already learned.  Sometimes I need inspiration, so I’ll go to a trade event to be around ‘my people’, or I’ll read a biography or a technical book by an animator.  Sometimes you can only progress so far by yourself till you hit a wall.  Find people that are doing what you are interested in and make contact.</p>\n","created_utc":1598403977,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1598404117,"fullname":"t3_931t","guild_id":"1vk","herald_guild":null,"id":"931t","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["92xp"],"permalink":"/+Talk/post/2mot/i-think-im-quitting-everything/931t","post_id":"2mot","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["931t"],"permalink":"/+Talk/post/2mot/i-think-im-quitting-everything/933v","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"I've about had it.
