So like, they can't go out and kill bad reviewers or something. The former usually refers to the interests of labor unions and worker ownership of the company and such.\r\n\r\n> If there's only three choices and all are extreme views of absolute SJW, Nazi, or libertarian, then SHOCK you're going to see a lot of libertarians. If you let people answer \"well I want a mix of carrot AND stick, in reasonable amounts with a cut-off threshold for hard cases and different paths for different offenses\"\r\n\r\nQuite a lot of people believe the censorship ones actually. You have to remember Ruqqus itself is skewed well into the libertarian section, but in the real world, especially outside the US you'll definitely run into crowds that don't believe in free speech. I also tried to word the options to make them only refer to extreme types of said speech, ie the \"hard cases\" you mentioned.

The name for <a href=\"/+WatchRuqqusDie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+WatchRuqqusDie/pic/profile\"/>+WatchRuqqusDie</a> is already taken, I don't think it is possible to siege it currently, and my account isn't even 30 days old yet. Perhaps one of us could create a guild that's like r/WatchRedditDie. <a href=\"/+The_Cabal\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_Cabal/pic/profile\"/>+The_Cabal</a> is already for that, but it's very inactive, doesn't have a guildmaster, and impossible to siege (I could be wrong about this, but again my account isn't 30 days old so I don't have the option available).
