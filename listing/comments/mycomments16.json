For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.\"</p>\n<p>May all personally encounter the presence and attention of the Lord God.</p>\n<p>Curiosity, questions, discussion, and prayer requests are welcome.</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_41","id":"41","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Christianity","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Christianity","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/profile-1.png"},"guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"137c5","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"If you interpret the Sermon on the Mount as saying its okay to acquire wealth, then I would read it again.","body_html":"<p>If you interpret the Sermon on the Mount as saying its okay to acquire wealth, then I would read it again.</p>\n","created_utc":1626785011,"downvotes":2,"edited_utc":1626785045,"fullname":"t3_136o3","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"136o3","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent_comment_id":["136lg"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a/136o3","post_id":"cs90","score":0,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["136o3"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a/137c5","post":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"I personally get a little irritated when someone of wealth and stature says they follow Christ's teachings.","body_html":"<p>I personally get a little irritated when someone of wealth and stature says they follow Christ's teachings.</p>\n","comment_count":65,"created_utc":1626752476,"domain":"text post","downvotes":2,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_cs90","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"cs90","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a","score":3,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Is it possible to be a wealthy Christian?","upvotes":5,"url":""},"post_id":"cs90","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":0}
