Unfortunately, these people almost always reupload what they find to gfycat, imgur, or i.ruqqus and <a href=\"https://i.redd.it\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">i.redd.it</a>, and link to that instead, so you can't find the source where they're getting all this content from. My only sources atm are reddit, google, imgur, gfycat, and hourly flops. Those are great for finding long-time popular reposts, but all except the latter are terrible for discovering <em>new</em> (quality) content. (Hourly flops is good, but people are clearly getting their content from many more sources than just that, and hourly flops only has pics, no videos/gifs).</p>\n<p>So, those of you who find a bunch of new fox pics and gifs all the time, what gives? Where are you getting them from, and where do you find them at?</p>\n<p>Edit: Foxposters, show yourselves!
