One thing I forgot to add though is that the actual game should be compiled with the <code>-rdynamic</code> flag or whatever your compiler's equivalent to that is, so make sure you do that, otherwise your mods won't be able to access variables and functions from the game. There are two example mods in the github repo, so if you're confused use them as a baseline.</p>\n","comment_count":2,"created_utc":1597693369,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_2c0h","guild_id":"35m","guild_name":"VoxelPlanet","herald_guild":null,"id":"2c0h","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":true,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+VoxelPlanet/post/2c0h/voxelplanet-is-now-moddable","score":4,"thumb_url":null,"title":"VoxelPlanet is now moddable!","upvotes":4,"url":""},"post_id":"2c0h","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":0}
