Keep supporting it and using it until when and if it dies like reddit and digg did.\r\n\r\nI'm only making this post in case anyone wonders why I quit participating. I think for me, I need to give things some time to cool down. Ever since the beginning, the admins haven't really gotten along with me. Why, I don't think either of us know, they just didn't. But it's led to endless back and forth fighting and rants between us and I think it's best if I quit for some time. I still enjoy the shitposting and political discussions, but the community is no fun when I can't really do anything in it because of the hot water between me and the admins. I do think they've been a bit unfair to me, at least until I started ranting about them, but I also completely overreact about every little thing they do in response. So my goal is to leave the site long enough for this to blow over. I don't want these stupid grudges to destroy this site for me or anyone else. Hopefully by the time I'm back we'll both be in a better mood. I don't know how long that will be. It could be a week, months, or even a year or two. But I will check the site occasionally to try and determine the best time to return.\r\n\r\nI won't leave forever, but it could be a while. So if there's anything you want to tell me or ask me before hand, please do so (troll and abusive replies will be ignored).

Keep supporting it and using it until when and if it dies like reddit and digg did.</p>\n<p>I'm only making this post in case anyone wonders why I quit participating. I think for me, I need to give things some time to cool down. Ever since the beginning, the admins haven't really gotten along with me. Why, I don't think either of us know, they just didn't. But it's led to endless back and forth fighting and rants between us and I think it's best if I quit for some time. I still enjoy the shitposting and political discussions, but the community is no fun when I can't really do anything in it because of the hot water between me and the admins. I do think they've been a bit unfair to me, at least until I started ranting about them, but I also completely overreact about every little thing they do in response. So my goal is to leave the site long enough for this to blow over. I don't want these stupid grudges to destroy this site for me or anyone else. Hopefully by the time I'm back we'll both be in a better mood. I don't know how long that will be. It could be a week, months, or even a year or two.
