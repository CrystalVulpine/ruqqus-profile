This place seems like a breath of fresh air. I have been a Redditor back when Aaron Swartz (RIP) was in charge. I wasn't a Digg immigrant. I was Reddit native.

Reddit was so dear to me and I had invested a lot of time there and it really hurts to see the trainwreck that it has become today.\r\n\r\nThis new generation Redditors wouldn't believe what Reddit used to be. For god's sake, we had a subreddit called jailbreak that was borderline legal. The first major Reddit controversy when the mainstream media found out about a subreddit about beating little girls.

Reddit did not start as a political website. But people who have been here are mostly after the 'Great Ban' which was mostly political. So, it's inevitable that politics will be a major theme here. But, that way, this site will go down the way of Saidit or Voat. And mainstream media saying false and nasty things about this community and discourage new users and commumity name dragged in the mud. So, we should try to bring organic non-political content.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion that we dedicate one day of the week to non-political post. Discourage (not ban) people from posting politics and related content. And artificially suppress those post on that day. You can still find and comment and all, but they will be towards the bottom on guild pages. Next day, they are back to normal.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** No site side ban on politics. Non-political posts get a bit boost for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n2. This is a long term suggestion but I guess we can build our community around it. Change the voting algorithm. I looked at the Ruqqus source at GitHub, (I am not a Python dev. I do PHP and C) and from what I get, Ruqqus does the old style voting. Upvote increases count by one while downvote decreases by one. The problem is that this system encourages bandwagoning and manipulation by clickfirms in China, India and Bangladesh. And I am sure, people will selling votes as we get popular. And we have to prevent it now. Also, any change now as opposed to a few years down the line will bring less community backlash. I propose two alternate algorithm.\r\n\r\n(a) Remove the upvotes/downvote button for posts. The post will have a votes but they will be calculated from the comment upvotes and downvotes. For example, the vote score might be the sum of all upvotes of all comment.\r\n\r\nThat way, to bandwagon or manipulate a content to the top you have to generate organic comments that clickfirms cannot do effectively.\r\n\r\n(b) A cooldown on the upvotes a user can give. A user on can give only a certain upvotes a day, say 5. After those 5 votes are given, that users vote will add only say .8 to the vote score, the next will add .64 to the vote, i.e, after the votes quota, the nth vote will contribute only .8^n to the vote score. Next day you start with 5 votes. Treat your votes as currency. And you only get so much a day.\r\n\r\nI mean, I don't say that these suggestion are without flaws. This is the internet and someone will come up with something that will destroy my entire argument. But can we atleast have a discussion about it. I have seen way too many sites come and go that fail to handle these problem. I don't want Ruqqus to be one of them.\r\n\r\nHave nice day, my friends.","body_html":"<p>TL;DR: Let's have a 'No-politics Monday' and a different algorithm for votes.</p>\n<p>Hi there.
