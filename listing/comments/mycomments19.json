If it was written as it stands, it was probably something to do with menstruation laws, or even doing it in the bed of a \"burnt offering\" which is the same word as \"woman\", and sexual acts were a common way of worshipping pagan gods in ancient times. As for the death penalty, that was unlikely actually prescribed; it's pretty obvious that Leviticus 18 was written first and that Leviticus 20 copies it, adding the legal penalties which largely go against God's nature.
