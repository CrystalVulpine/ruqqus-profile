I wrote this more with regards to my experience with 'social' sites that collate other articles and allow regular people to add their own comments / material - a source I look for to add context to a published article.\r\n\r\nNot sure where on Ruqqus to post this, but it seems to fit the bill best here. Feel free to dump to +General otherwise.\r\nTL;DR: Let's try to be better than football team politics.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nReddit used to be my go-to place for a neutral amalgamation of the week's news and public opinion, but with their increasingly bold-faced censorship and manipulation it's become clear that their neutrality (or at the very least equal representation of all biases) has now completely disappeared. In my search for truth I've taken to browsing different message boards / public platforms across the spectrum and trying to parse all of the bullshit for the common facts - but I'm finding more and more extremes of opinion to have to cut through. \r\n\r\nIn left-leaning places we get:\r\n\r\n- People demanding that the world validates and humours their every personal identity crisis or be punished\r\n- Martyring of violent criminals who threatened police, declarations that \"All Cops Are Bastards\", and campaigning to exchange law and order for what is essentially vigilante justice\r\n- Harassment, legal action and job losses for anyone who dares to have said or done something the mob doesn't like - past or present\r\n- Demands for censorship of anything slightly uncomfortable (we should've seen it coming when 'trigger warnings' became a thing)\r\n- Blind support for anything that sounds 'progressive' without any further investigation or scrutiny\r\n- A bizarre trend of self-flagellation for historical events that modern people had no part in\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the right-leaning sites:\r\n\r\n- A slurry of derogatory terms for every race, and lazy stereotyping\r\n- Pushing overblown ultra-conservative nonsense just to 'trigger the libs', rather than from any personal convictions\r\n- Childish memes where anything and anyone left of middle America gets mocked as screaming rainbow children against stoic, conservative 'real men' (Looking at you, PCM)\r\n- Tinfoiling about ((the Jews)) at every opportunity\r\n- Christian fundamentalists chomping at the bit for The Crusades II and going on puritanical rants about the evils of sexual liberation\r\n- Lamenting the end of 'racial purity' as though nobody ever fucked outside their village before the 1950s (all of the white women you'll ever get to have sex with have already been born - calm down)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't particularly give a shit where the dot is on your political compass, but the ever-widening gap between the 'left' and 'right' is getting so silly I can't even search for the grains of truth between the extremes without rolling my eyes into the back of my head.

The people of the covenant have simply each decided that you are not welcome here. This is their right as property owners. If I entered your commune and started freely and voluntarily exchanging goods and services and claiming property, i would probably be shot. At least we only tell you to go somewhere else.</p>\n<p>And while a covenant may not silence dissent, your comparison to Voat is actually the best possible argument you could have made against yourself, because the bullshit of Voat was met with- guess what- Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>Nobody is stopping you from starting a Covenant yourself, all you need is property and like-minded neighbours, as I keep helplessly repeating throughout this entire conversation to only be met with \"b-b-b-but what about muh ROADS! Destroyed.\"-level childish responses</p>\n","created_utc":1594043825,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_2989","guild_id":"s8","herald_guild":null,"id":"2989","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":5,"parent_comment_id":["28h8"],"permalink":"/+PoliticalCompassMemes/post/u8e/righties-can-be-watermelons-too/2989","post_id":"u8e","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["2989"],"permalink":"/+PoliticalCompassMemes/post/u8e/righties-can-be-watermelons-too/29ib","post":{"author_name":"notabot","award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":68,"created_utc":1593968362,"domain":"i.redd.it","downvotes":9,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_u8e","guild_id":"s8","guild_name":"PoliticalCompassMemes","herald_guild":null,"id":"u8e","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+PoliticalCompassMemes/post/u8e/righties-can-be-watermelons-too","score":248,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/u8e/thumb.png","title":"Righties can be watermelons too","upvotes":260,"url":"https://i.redd.it/eak4buacu1951.jpg"},"post_id":"u8e","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
