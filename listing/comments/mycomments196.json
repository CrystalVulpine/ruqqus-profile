They are very exclusive about who gets to be a mod, and consistently refuse to consider adding anyone outside their own circle even when they can't keep up with the mod work. Add in the fact that the dominant mod team (DefaultMods) is directly linked to the admins, to the point that the admins could probably be considered <em>part</em> of their clique, and things are <em>really</em> bad. It's undeniable that certain users have a lot more influence over the site than everyone else, and just as they and the admins relentlessly complain about everyone else doing, they are always acting in <em>bad faith</em>.</p>\n","created_utc":1593135162,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_1b3l","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#ff4500","created_utc":1580069029,"description":"Documenting the fall of Reddit.","description_html":"<p>Documenting the fall of Reddit.</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_1c","id":"1c","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"WatchRedditDie","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/watchredditdie/profile-5.png"},"guild_id":"1c","herald_guild":null,"id":"1b3l","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent":{"author_name":"Privacybuddy","award_count":0,"body":"It's called being a basement dweller who literally does nothing but go on reddit today.","body_html":"<p>It's called being a basement dweller who literally does nothing but go on reddit today.</p>\n","created_utc":1593097768,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_1a64","guild_id":"1c","herald_guild":null,"id":"1a64","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent_comment_id":["19uw"],"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie/post/n22/6-powermods-control-118-of-the/1a64","post_id":"n22","score":6,"upvotes":7,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["1a64"],"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie/post/n22/6-powermods-control-118-of-the/1b3l","post":{"author_name":"_Account_964","award_count":0,"body":"**Edit: [Here](https://ruqq.us/n3k) is an uncensored version**\r\n\r\nCredit to /u/FreeSpeechWarrior on reddit for making this","body_html":"<p><strong>Edit: <a href=\"https://ruqq.us/n3k\">Here</a> is an uncensored version</strong></p>\n<p>Credit to /u/FreeSpeechWarrior on reddit for making this</p>\n","comment_count":34,"created_utc":1593079092,"domain":"i.redd.it","downvotes":2,"edited_utc":1593100591,"fullname":"t2_n22","guild_id":"1c","guild_name":"WatchRedditDie","herald_guild":null,"id":"n22","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie/post/n22/6-powermods-control-118-of-the","score":90,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/n22/thumb.png","title":"6 powermods control 118 of the top 500 subreddits.","upvotes":90,"url":"https://i.redd.it/pyv0sdl2o0z41.png"},"post_id":"n22","score":1,"upvotes":2,"voted":0}
