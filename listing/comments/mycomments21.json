What a retarded thing to say.","body_html":"<p>I simply disagreed there were genuine trannies and you seem to agree at this point that there are in fact no genuine trannies. It doesn't matter if they don't like something about themselves and do something about it. That doesn't mean I don't think it's retarded and that I'm going to stop mocking them for being retards. I don't believe it has much to do with one side or the other. I think the vast majority of these people have a fetish and hormones do not temporarily remove your sex drive entirely.
