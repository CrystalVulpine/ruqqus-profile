If someone likes most things that happen to the other sex's brain and body and dislike what their own does, it makes sense for them to wish they were born the opposite.</p>\n","created_utc":1625969818,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_12lxo","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/transrights/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1600141521,"description":"THIS SUBREDDIT IDENTIFIES AS A MENTAL HEALTH SUBREDDIT\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF RUQQUS DOES NOT RESPECT OUR IDENTITY AND THAT IS LITERAL VIOLENCE","description_html":"<p>THIS SUBREDDIT IDENTIFIES AS A MENTAL HEALTH SUBREDDIT</p>\n<p>THE ADMINISTRATION OF RUQQUS DOES NOT RESPECT OUR IDENTITY AND THAT IS LITERAL VIOLENCE</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_3zq","id":"3zq","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"transrights","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+transrights","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/transrights/profile-1.png"},"guild_id":"3zq","herald_guild":null,"id":"12lxo","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":6,"parent":{"author_name":"AlexJonesThirdBall","award_count":0,"body":"Would you be able to describe for me the differences between a man's and a woman's brains which are consistent across brain scans?","body_html":"<p>Would you be able to describe for me the differences between a man's and a woman's brains which are consistent across brain scans?</p>\n","created_utc":1625968862,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1625968889,"fullname":"t3_12lwo","guild_id":"3zq","herald_guild":null,"id":"12lwo","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":5,"parent_comment_id":["12lvg"],"permalink":"/+transrights/post/clfh/the-face-says-it-all/12lwo","post_id":"clfh","score":4,"upvotes":4,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["12lwo"],"permalink":"/+transrights/post/clfh/the-face-says-it-all/12lxo","post":{"guild_name":"transrights","id":"clfh","is_banned":false,"is_deleted":true,"permalink":"/+transrights/post/clfh/the-face-says-it-all","title":"The face says it all"},"post_id":"clfh","score":0,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}

This would not be of consequence if female bodies were not occupied by persons - souls - and were instead some kind of plant. But, as such, the female body is a cruelty designed to stifle and prevent all instances of the inhabitant’s agency.</p>\n<p>The female body features prominent exhibitory fat deposits that are there to benefit ONLY others - a man and his children - not the inhabitant; it is less capable of developing muscle mass because of this; it is handicapped by pain and bleeding every month; its hands, feet, and bones are smaller and less capable; its stature is unintimidating; and it’s hormones give rise to a psychological state that is cowardly, irrational, concerned with things of little consequence, and submissive.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with the male body: it features a lower body fat percentage; easily acquired muscle mass; larger hands, feet, and bones that increase stability, speed, and damage done to attackers; an intimidating stature; and it’s hormones encourage a logical, engineering-oriented, and domineering psychological disposition. It is made to enable and enhance the inhabitant’s agency.</p>\n<p>It is as if either the creator or the circumstances that resulted in the female body’s creation intentionally designed it to attract exploitation; it was ensured that the inhabitant would be unable to assert dominance over her physical domain, inept at constructing solutions to in-world problems, and unable to resist the aggressive assertions of males upon her person. Yet, it is in a shape that is very appealing, soft and enticing even. Because of this, males would long to force the above mentioned outcome upon her - even against her will. And, because of the disabilities her body is afflicted with, she would need to submit to the will of males to acquire protection and the resources and permission to accomplish anything of consequence.</p>\n<p>Females who accept and even delight in existing in this disabled state are women. They are feminine; whether or not they have souls or not is questionable. The feminine spirit is cowardly, it is a doormat, it is not inclined to gain hard skills, it wastes time, it hates progress and reasoning, it chatters, it is melodramatic, it is overly concerned with the feelings of others, it is self-destructive, etc…. Consequently, women accept uselessness, subjugation, emotionalism, endless self-sacrifice, and male sexuality. Most gruesomely, they accept the curse of a womb - the instrument of suppressed agency’s suicide - and forceful association with children in every culture and almost every psyche.</p>\n<p>Women are deserving of hatred both because they embrace mass uselessness and burdensome behavior for themselves and because their existence undermines and invites violent “conversion” efforts upon females who are not women. Males assume their desire to inseminate females translates, in females, into a desire to have children. But, it does not. Males are given justification (by women) in assuming that it is right and enjoyable for the inhabitants of the female body to be afflicted with these things and prevented from meaningful living. It is not, but males come to believe it is a defect to be forcibly and/or socially corrected when a female does not enjoy these things. In fact, it is a defect to enjoy any of it. All the while, women do not help - they can’t see why other females would even want “agency.”</p>\n<p>But, females who recognize and are displeased with this cosmic cruelty desperately try to escape their prison. And, given the option, they’re choosing to adopt a non-binary presentation or become “transmen” - they are rejecting femininity and choosing to let their appearance evade association with women and obscure their female birth. In return, they are gaining a body that is capable and a presentation that can be respected. Can you blame them?</p>\n<p>Given the option, why would you - a person/a soul - want to be trapped in the female body?</p>\n<p>You wouldn’t, so given the objective uselessness of the female body and the cruelty of a soul being imprisoned in one, it seems useful, ethical and even necessary to correct this mistake altogether. This can be done by genetically modifying the female body to gain strength and muscle mass with the ease that males can, increase in average stature, and to be psychologically oriented toward engineering and problem solving rather than irrationality and emotionalism. The female body should maintain it’s only assets - the female shape, soft skin, and hairlessness. There will be no penis.</p>\n<p>Tl;dr - The female body is a prison and all females should be trans.</p>\n","comment_count":12,"created_utc":1625959000,"domain":"static.independent.co.uk","downvotes":10,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_cle2","guild_id":"35","guild_name":"UnpopularOpinion","herald_guild":null,"id":"cle2","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+UnpopularOpinion/post/cle2/all-females-should-be-trans-or","score":-5,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/cle2/thumb.png","title":"All females should be trans or genetically modified to reject all psychological connotations of the word “woman.”","upvotes":7,"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/10/jay-jackson-by-reuben.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75"},"post_id":"cle2","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":0}
