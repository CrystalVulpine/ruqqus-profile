His zeal caused him to be dragged before the sultan for insulting the Moslem religion and he spent three days hung from a set of gallows by a chain attached to hooks in one hand and one foot. Faithful Catholics should also deplore the example of St. Peter Mavimenus, who died in 715 after being tortured for three days for having insulted Mohammed and Islam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>John Paul II on this topic, stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that we, Christians and Moslems, we must recognize with joy the religious values that we have in common and give thanks to God. (…) We believe that God will be a merciful judge at the end of time and we hope that after the resurrection He will satisfied with us, and that we will be satisfied with Him.\" John Paul II, translated from the French version of his Address on the occasion of meeting young people at the stadium of Casablanca, August 18, 1985, DC 1903, p. 945.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, these contradictions suggest there is doubt that John Paul II should have been canonized, and therefore there is doubt that \"pope\" Francis (who \"canonized\" him) is a true Catholic pope.</p>\n<p>This is one topic that suggests sedevacantism is true.</p>\n<p>What do you think about this problem of modern \"canonizations\"?</p>\n","comment_count":8,"created_utc":1625851031,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_cki3","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"cki3","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cki3/doubts-about-modern-catholic-saints","score":3,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Doubts About Modern \"Catholic Saints\"","upvotes":3,"url":""},"post_id":"cki3","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
