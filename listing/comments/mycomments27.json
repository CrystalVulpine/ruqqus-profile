Maybe they wouldn't be so uncomfortable with trans people if it weren't for you fighting mostly for access to the womens' bathroom for people who still have a penis, athletes blatantly cheating by switching to the weaker team, and unbelievable college snowflakes freaking out about because someone dared \"assume their gender\". And then you pushed it even further, and now you've got them insisting that everyone follow defined gender roles and wanting to repeal the 19th. Maybe they would even be willing to get along you, but you said no, and there's definitely no going back now. Think about it, if a bunch of crazy people are constantly screaming about something relentlessly, you're going to start loathing said thing, even if you otherwise would've loved it. And those crazy people are what you are. Good job, you've managed to turn half the country against everything it once believed in to destroy you and everything you've made them associate with you. But hey, at least you can pull out your precious victim card, which was probably the plan all along!</p>\n","comment_count":218,"created_utc":1625365195,"domain":"text post","downvotes":6,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_cggc","guild_id":"35","guild_name":"UnpopularOpinion","herald_guild":null,"id":"cggc","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+UnpopularOpinion/post/cggc/dear-liberals-its-your-fault-that","score":142,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Dear liberals: It's your fault that conservatives have become authright assholes","upvotes":145,"url":""},"post_id":"cggc","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
