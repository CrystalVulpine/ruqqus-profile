Not even if the best thing ever happens to us. We've got no creativity, no mental talent, no emotions except anger, and basically our brains don't work because they're hyperfocused on the spatial world for fighting and hunting and laboring. There is pretty much nothing positive about being male, it basically means you're a disposable slave good for nothing but working and breeding and dying. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_expendability\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_expendability</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Part of why I put so much of my time and energy into art is because I'm suffering internally.

I definitely had a completely different mind and it was both a lot more capable and a lot more exciting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to be good at something, just do it and be bad at it for a while.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of the things I do are difficult to enjoy without being good at them. Because most of them produce a result, and having that is half the fun.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compare yourself only to your past self.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I say this <em>because</em> my past self was way better at almost everything. The only exception being not having as much raw knowledge and experience, but definitely superior in the talent department.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, if you put half as much energy into an actual skill as you do making these long, convoluted, mopy comments, you'd be a master by now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been doing that my whole life and gone backwards. It's my brain that's the problem. You know what the real issue is? I've got the wrong interests for the equipment I've got, that's what. I don't know how that happened as it seems pretty rare, but nothing I can do to change either of them. My brain just isn't equipped to work with what I want to do.</p>\n","created_utc":1628594255,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1628594531,"fullname":"t3_14rl9","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1581786138,"description":"Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n🤔 Posts must be questions.
