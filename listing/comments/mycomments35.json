The heroes are progressives -- ethnically diverse soldiers, originally led by a strong woman, Major Prasad. Prasad dies in the first chapter.\r\n\r\nYou must play as a duo of rangers. Choices include gay lovers and a father-daughter team. The poz is strong with this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary enemies are the rebellious factions of what seems to be a fundamentalist Christian sect. The bad guys of the first chapter talk with exaggerated accents. They sound like Hollywood voice actors who had been told to do Appalachian accents but had only prepared by watching Burt Reynolds in *Deliverance*. The rangers are on a mission to get help from \"the Patriarch,\" who is the authorized leader of the rednecks. The sledgehammer angst and cheap drama of the first chapter lead me to suspect that the player will be encouraged to hate the Patriarch and all that he stands for, and to see cooperation with him as tragic. However, the game is not very interesting, so it is not likely that I will play most of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people who made this game have some rabid fans who will praise it regardless of how it plays or what the story is like. The game makers had always been fans of cheap melodrama and sledgehammer angst, but to the best of my knowledge this is the first time they have nailed their rainbow-striped Pride flag to their mast.\r\n\r\nA further note on the idiocy of the development team:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8\r\n\r\nOne often-repeated piece of music is a version of an old Christian hymn.
