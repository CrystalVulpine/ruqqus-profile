But this double role of normative discourse inevitably raises the idea of supererogation, the category of actions that are praiseworthy (either in creating good states of affairs or in reflecting a particularly virtuous trait of character) yet at the same time not obligatory. Supererogation lies at the intersection of the axiological and the deontic, the ‚Äògood‚Äô and the ‚Äòought‚Äô. Since moral theories of the past (like Aristotle, Kant and utilitarianism) all appeal in some form to both deontic and axiological concepts, the scant and cursory discussion of supererogation in those theories is all the more surprising.\r\n\r\n> The most notable exception to this historical generalization is the long-standing and elaborate Roman Catholic doctrine of opera supererogationis. The general background of this doctrine is the recognition of the two faces of morality under the concepts of ‚Äúprecepts‚Äù and ‚Äúcounsels.‚Äù The origins of this distinction go back to the New Testament, in which to the question what one should do to gain eternal life, Jesus replies: ‚Äúif thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,‚Äù but adds ‚Äúif thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven‚Äù (Matthew xix, 16‚Äì24). Beyond charity, the Church Fathers detected in the New Testament two additional evangelical counsels, chastity and obedience: taking a wife is no sin, but virginity has a superior value; the life of an ordinary Christian cannot be blamed, but that of absolute monastic dedication is far better. Forgiveness and love of one‚Äôs enemies are also religious ideals that originate in the New Testament and were sometimes given a supererogatory interpretation in later Church doctrine.\r\n\r\n> The Old Law of the Old Testament is regarded by early Catholic thinkers as reflecting the rigid and minimal demands of religious morality, typically formulated in the negative terms of prohibitions and precepts (the violation of which entails punishment). The New Law, that of the New Testament, sometimes called the Law of Liberty, leaves the individual free to pursue more edifying ideals of perfection. Tertullian called this freedom licentia. According to the Catholic doctrine, the special merit of supererogatory acts accredited to their agent can be used both for that individual‚Äôs own salvation and for the salvation of others. The ‚Äúsuperabundant merit,‚Äù most typically collected by the actions of Jesus and the saints, who far exceeded what was required for their own salvation, is deposited in the Spiritual Treasury of the Church to be disposed by the Pope and the bishops for remitting the sins of other, ordinary believers. This is how the institution of Indulgences gradually developed in the late middle ages: sinners could buy the remission of their sins, first by joining the Crusades and later by contributing money to the coffers of the Church.\r\n\r\n> The most articulate exposition of the doctrine of supererogation in the Christian tradition is found in Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica). Thomas mentions two distinct sources of merit of supererogatory behavior. On the one hand supererogation serves as a more expedient or guaranteed way of achieving everlasting life; on the other, it is intrinsically good in being aimed at higher ends than the mere fulfillment of the commandments. Precepts are universal in their scope, whereas counsels are addressed to the few who have the capacity and inclination to pursue the life of perfection. For Thomas, the open-texture character of the counsels of supererogation is what makes the morality of love superior to the authoritarian nature of the strict law. But Thomas does not draw a clear borderline between duty and supererogation. It is, for example, not clear whether ‚Äúlove thy enemy‚Äù is a precept or a supererogatory counsel. It is similarly unclear whether beneficence (almsgiving) is a duty or lies beyond duty. Nor is the role of virtue in demarcating the supererogatory from the obligatory explained. Thomas says that both natural law and positive law prescribe acts of virtue in general but they do not prescribe every specific virtuous act (except for those that promote the social good of justice and peace). And as for divine law, it prescribes also other, non-social actions that belong to the relations between man and God but leaves those actions of perfect virtue to the realm of supererogatory counsel.\r\n\r\n(Note: Not sure how much Catholics agree with some of the following, how much the \"institution of indulgences\" was \"commericialized\", but this seems to accurately portray the views of the \"Reformers\")\r\n\r\n> The Catholic doctrine of supererogation met with an extremely fierce opposition in the times of the Reformation. Luther, Calvin and Anglican theologians attacked both the theory of ‚Äúsuper-meritorious‚Äù actions and the corruption involved in the commercialization of the institution of indulgences for which the theory served as a cover. No human being, not even a saint, can do all that is strictly required as a duty, let alone hope to go beyond that. The way to salvation is not through ‚Äúworks‚Äù but through divine grace alone (Luther 1957). Even the most dramatic acts of martyrdom and self-sacrifice, which served the Catholics as paradigm examples of supererogation, are strictly speaking obligatory. Protestant ethics thus undermines the distinction between the two faces of morality: on the one hand, normative requirements cannot be defined in terms of rules fixing minimally prescribed behavior; on the other hand, every religiously good behavior is obligatory. Saints and sinners are equally dependent on God‚Äôs grace for their salvation. Paradoxically, it may be noted, exactly because human actions can never fulfill God‚Äôs commandments, divine grace is never due or ethically called for: it is typically supererogatory, a free gift of God!","body_html":"<p>Summary for reflection: there are some things that are obligations, and then there are actions that go beyond that (supererogatory acts) which are even better but not required (\"going the extra mile\").</p>\n<p>I've found this distinction important to make at times as frequently some people expect as obligation what is already beyond what is necessary (\"the most I am capable of is what I must do\"), or may go to the other extreme of not defining minimum obligatory acts in certain situations, which might create a sense of guilt of not having fulfilled moral requirements.</p>\n<p>Certain supererogatory acts might be wrong to do as they are beyond one's capacity or calling.
