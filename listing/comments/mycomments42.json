If there is an infallible text anywhere, it isn't the bible, an even less likely an arrangement of it that didn't exist until the 14th century. I know of no such text, nor do I think the word of God can be fit into words. The good guys in the bible communicated with God directly and others criticized them for breaking the rules and not bowing down to whatever religious institution was impersonating for God at the time. There are accounts in many of the prophets of the Israelites perverting the law and the scriptures and changing them to their liking, which is why the old testament is so barbaric and supports pagan ideas like sacrifices and legalism and prosperity gospel. It is also clear that earlier writers did not know the torah which was supposedly given by Moses, and even the later ones didn't have it in any form we'd recognize today until Ezra-Nehemiah, characters who were paranoid about the \"holy race\" being tainted by goyim and are testified by many sources as being the final redactors of the old testament, which is implied even in their own book.

God speaks about how his words are pure, and unchanging, and kept completely preserved for all generations.\r\n\r\nYou are trying to prove that the Bible is infallible using statements about \"God's words\" which I already established is not the Bible. Not to mention that this is circular logic; the few books that do claim infallibility (the torah, revelation) are exactly the ones which are unlikely to be authentic, and even then only make that claim about themselves, not other books.\r\n\r\n> So them changing certain words, or excluding books or including ones that aren't scripture, this does not match the promises to us that God has made.\r\n\r\nThe only way you can think this is if someone else just told you and you accepted it without question. Stop being so trusting of other people, including the ones who call themselves believers. There are hundreds of thousands of differences in biblical manuscripts, many of them significant, and that's just the beginning as the majority of the editing would've occurred prior to all our manuscript evidence. That's for the *new* testament, which only had about 2-300 years between composition and our first manuscripts. Imagine the old testament after almost 3,000 years and *at least* two major redactions. The protestant bible you know of didn't exist until Luther. The bible itself didn't exist until 382 AD, and even then canons were wildly different across denominations (and yes, those existed back then, and a lot of things we would immediately consider heresy now were legitimate controversies in those days). God never promised an inerrant text about anything; only men.\r\n\r\n> And this promise is for all generations, so certain time periods where we didn't have the books or weren't' aware of them is not possible.\r\n\r\nYour own argument betrays you, because there was who knows how long before the time of Moses, probably a lot longer than has passed since then, when not a single book of the Bible had been written yet.

But this is even more foolish of a notion. You first claim that God has always provided the Bible, then claim that the only authentic Bible is a version not produced until 400 years ago. Tell me, when did God ever specifically sanction the King James Bible? The answer is he didn't, and that it is merely a translation produced in 1611, only in Jacobean English we can barely read today, and with much less scholarly knowledge to make informed decisions. And what do you think its sources were? The very same Greek and Hebrew source texts you attack, only much later and slightly more corrupted ones. So since God never told you that the King James Bible is perfect, then by what authority do you make such a claim? What others have told you? Don't be so trusting.\r\n\r\n> but that doesn't change that The King James has been preserved the past 400 years for us and hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nActually it has: the apocrypha has been removed, an update was made in the 18th century, and several very wild printing errors have been fixed. That said, it's much easier for a text produced in the early days of the information age, when printing existed, and recent enough to still have the original copy of it, to remain as it is than in the days when paper and ink were expensive, the church oversaw everything, and everything was handcopied, and editing a text you were copying was not usually regarded as wrong.\r\n\r\n> You might think the men that wrote the King James were corrupt or using it to manipulate the people, there is history that says otherwise, but ultimately that would be a spiritual decision on your part. For every critique thrown at it, there is always an explanation. Or maybe there are books in the 66 you doubt?\r\n\r\nThe original King James Bible contains 80 books, not 66. So since you yourself doubt books 14 books, who are you to judge me for also doubting certain books?\r\n\r\n> Throwing out Paul's teachings is common amongst Christians today, but he is the apostle to the gentiles and Jesus did appear to him.\r\n\r\nIt was actually more common in ancient times. Christians today elevate Paul over Jesus, mostly ignoring the gospels and studying mainly Paul's letters and the other epistles supposedly written by \"apostles\", with a bit of Torah mixed in. In ancient times you had several sects that went as far as denouncing Paul as an apostate. The catholic church did not agree, but tended to avoid Paul in the early days, not so much because of anything about Paul, but because many heretics were so fanatic about him and they didn't want to become associated with them. Paul, as far as I can tell, was a legitimate evangelist in the first century, and his letters are good, but he is not infallible and his writings are heavily redacted to conform with church doctrine. This does not include 1 Timothy and Titus which are undoubtedly forgeries preaching evil doctrines and usually at odds with authentic Paul; it is very obvious from their contents that they were written to \"prove\" the authority of the church.\r\n\r\nI do not have time to individually refute every single quote of yours, but not one of them references any kind of Bible.

So them changing certain words, or excluding books or including ones that aren't scripture, this does not match the promises to us that God has made.
