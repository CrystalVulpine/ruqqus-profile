I'm 17 and I'm going through a sort of mini-midlife crisis right now realizing I threw my entire childhood down the shitter, partly because of suppressed shame from an autism (mis)diagnosis. I'm stoned right now so if this is awkward then I'm sorry. I'll probably be deleting this when I wake up tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to talk about the diagnosis of Asperger's/autism and why I think it's really so commonly diagnosed, and how it's actually making kids worse.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I do think Asperger's is a real disorder, but it's actually much rarer than it's made out to be. The problem isn't an increase in autism, but rather an increase in normal, socially awkward kids being misdiagnosed.\r\n\r\nAlright, with that out of the way, let's get down to business.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I *do* know what I'm doing. I know I'm weird, I could control it, but I simply don't. And I'm too embarrassed to admit it. I've been like this my whole life.  Rather than change, I simply suppressed my negative thoughts for most of my life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Asperger's diagnosis came along in 2011, I was already confused about my emotions and too frightened to admit what was going on. All the sudden, I believed I couldn't improve no matter what, and I think I just gave up. I forgot all my emotions thinking they were a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself.\r\n\r\nI was homeschooled and extremely sheltered until 2019 when I tried to take the reigns and go to a public high school. There's a big culture shock leaving the small home I was stuck in for this big, complex real world. The fact that this wasn't considered by doctors is pretty surprising, but I probably never told them how I felt in the first place knowing how shy I was.\r\n\r\nSince I was 6, I've had no joy in life. Maybe you could call it depression? I would. The world is dull, grey, numb, cold, and indifferent to me from my perspective. Nobody gives a shit about me. That's how I feel. My parents are strange and crazy enough and me, being homeschooled, had no way of realizing that (I actually did, but I think I ended up numbing myself to that early on to protect myself from the pain). My dad has always taught me to see the bad in everything. He's a miserable man.\r\n\r\nI have always been extremely passive aggressive. I think I hate my parents, but hid it so deep within my head that it fell into my subconscious for a long time.\r\n\r\nI've become so confused about my own emotions that I've lost any shred of personality I may have been able to develop, and have instead become lost in a false persona. I killed my soul, buried it, and built a new one, and I can't find a shovel to dig up the old one.\r\n\r\nI think my parents have played a huge role in all this. I still have to keep my false, naive child persona around them rather than truly mature because I cannot live with what how I've acted and how I've made a fool of myself. I did try to change somewhat in 2019, but I just can't embrace normality until I can get away from everyone who knows my past. Imagine this kid (https://youtu.be/IORGuTdpSeo) amped up by about 3 times exactly (I am being literal), and that would be me until 15 and a half. And look at the way his parents act around him (I recently rediscovered my ability to read body language after I forgot it as a preteen after years of doing nothing but using the internet), and even how they talk about him. They clearly hate him, and maybe they themselves are suppressing their hatred for him. He and I are very similar.\r\n\r\nDon't think it's all their fault though. I have always chosen vengeance, anger, and fear and the low route in general throughout my entire life. I am motivated completely by self interest because I'm too scared to see the objectifive reality and how much of a loser I really am. I am such a pussy to the point that I'm too afraid to learn from my own mistakes. Humiliation is terrifying to me.\r\nBut they did a lot to push me into this position of fearful rage.\r\n\r\nMy point is, I display many of the autistic symptoms almost by choice for some reason, and I know it's because I made so many terrible choices growing up. I've chosen to be a man child.\r\n\r\nNow, considering how typical this is unexplainably with kids today, while also considering how different the social climate is, and the fact that there are no consistent differences in the high functioning autistic brain structure compared to a normal one, I find it hard to believe this is a true neurological disorder. Instead, I believe Asperger's/High functioning autism is a new phenomenon (Strange how that behavior was so rare in the Past compared to now) caused by a generation of awkward millennial (gen y and z) children having difficulties adapting to the new mid 21st century culture while battling memories of the less cynical late 20th/early 21st century. They are so afraid and distant that they don't even want to understand why they're afraid. \r\n\r\nThere is no high functioning autism. Just unattractive (we do tend to be ugly) children with severe anxiety and a tendency towards extreme passive aggressiveness as well as roleplaying.\r\n\r\nRather than face these issues, the confused children are told it's out of their control and hopelessy choose to withdraw into a fantasy world.\r\n\r\nFor lower functioning cases, I don't have as much of a problem (there are noticeable differences in brain structure). As for high functioning autism, I think we're setting a generation up for a world of hurt.\r\n\r\nWe're not retards (no offense to the lower functioning). We're twisted and confused in our own goals and unwilling to change out of fear.\r\n\r\nI'm so distant and separate from everyone in life that I'm not entirely in reality.\r\n\r\nThe last lines of Black Sabbath's song, \"paranoid,\" really resonate with me. \"And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state, I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nIt feels too late. \r\n\r\nBut as an adult, I will be able to have a second chance. It's not over yet. I have another 10 years that have the potential to be infinitely better than the last.\r\n\r\nAutism, at least in my case, is caused by a bad mindset I've adapted over the years. And I think that's the way it is for most people \"on the spectrum\" at this point.\r\n\r\nEdit: Alright, I'm not gonna take this down. Thank you all for your support. It means a lot to me.","body_html":"<p>Hey Ruqqies.

The fact that this wasn't considered by doctors is pretty surprising, but I probably never told them how I felt in the first place knowing how shy I was.\r\n\r\nSince I was 6, I've had no joy in life. Maybe you could call it depression? I would. The world is dull, grey, numb, cold, and indifferent to me from my perspective. Nobody gives a shit about me. That's how I feel. My parents are strange and crazy enough and me, being homeschooled, had no way of realizing that (I actually did, but I think I ended up numbing myself to that early on to protect myself from the pain). My dad has always taught me to see the bad in everything. He's a miserable man.\r\n\r\nI have always been extremely passive aggressive. I think I hate my parents, but hid it so deep within my head that it fell into my subconscious for a long time.\r\n\r\nI've become so confused about my own emotions that I've lost any shred of personality I may have been able to develop, and have instead become lost in a false persona. I killed my soul, buried it, and built a new one, and I can't find a shovel to dig up the old one.\r\n\r\nI think my parents have played a huge role in all this. I still have to keep my false, naive child persona around them rather than truly mature because I cannot live with what how I've acted and how I've made a fool of myself. I did try to change somewhat in 2019, but I just can't embrace normality until I can get away from everyone who knows my past. Imagine this kid (https://youtu.be/IORGuTdpSeo) amped up by about 3 times exactly (I am being literal), and that would be me until 15 and a half. And look at the way his parents act around him (I recently rediscovered my ability to read body language after I forgot it as a preteen after years of doing nothing but using the internet), and even how they talk about him. They clearly hate him, and maybe they themselves are suppressing their hatred for him. He and I are very similar.\r\n\r\nDon't think it's all their fault though. I have always chosen vengeance, anger, and fear and the low route in general throughout my entire life. I am motivated completely by self interest because I'm too scared to see the objectifive reality and how much of a loser I really am. I am such a pussy to the point that I'm too afraid to learn from my own mistakes. Humiliation is terrifying to me.\r\nBut they did a lot to push me into this position of fearful rage.\r\n\r\nMy point is, I display many of the autistic symptoms almost by choice for some reason, and I know it's because I made so many terrible choices growing up. I've chosen to be a man child.\r\n\r\nNow, considering how typical this is unexplainably with kids today, while also considering how different the social climate is, and the fact that there are no consistent differences in the high functioning autistic brain structure compared to a normal one, I find it hard to believe this is a true neurological disorder. Instead, I believe Asperger's/High functioning autism is a new phenomenon (Strange how that behavior was so rare in the Past compared to now) caused by a generation of awkward millennial (gen y and z) children having difficulties adapting to the new mid 21st century culture while battling memories of the less cynical late 20th/early 21st century. They are so afraid and distant that they don't even want to understand why they're afraid. \r\n\r\nThere is no high functioning autism. Just unattractive (we do tend to be ugly) children with severe anxiety and a tendency towards extreme passive aggressiveness as well as roleplaying.\r\n\r\nRather than face these issues, the confused children are told it's out of their control and hopelessy choose to withdraw into a fantasy world.\r\n\r\nFor lower functioning cases, I don't have as much of a problem (there are noticeable differences in brain structure). As for high functioning autism, I think we're setting a generation up for a world of hurt.\r\n\r\nWe're not retards (no offense to the lower functioning).

It's not over yet. I have another 10 years that have the potential to be infinitely better than the last.\r\n\r\nAutism, at least in my case, is caused by a bad mindset I've adapted over the years.

It means a lot to me.","body_html":"<p>Hey Ruqqies. I'm 17 and I'm going through a sort of mini-midlife crisis right now realizing I threw my entire childhood down the shitter, partly because of suppressed shame from an autism (mis)diagnosis. I'm stoned right now so if this is awkward then I'm sorry. I'll probably be deleting this when I wake up tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to talk about the diagnosis of Asperger's/autism and why I think it's really so commonly diagnosed, and how it's actually making kids worse.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I do think Asperger's is a real disorder, but it's actually much rarer than it's made out to be. The problem isn't an increase in autism, but rather an increase in normal, socially awkward kids being misdiagnosed.</p>\n<p>Alright, with that out of the way, let's get down to business.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I <em>do</em> know what I'm doing. I know I'm weird, I could control it, but I simply don't. And I'm too embarrassed to admit it. I've been like this my whole life.  Rather than change, I simply suppressed my negative thoughts for most of my life.</p>\n<p>When the Asperger's diagnosis came along in 2011, I was already confused about my emotions and too frightened to admit what was going on. All the sudden, I believed I couldn't improve no matter what, and I think I just gave up. I forgot all my emotions thinking they were a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself.</p>\n<p>I was homeschooled and extremely sheltered until 2019 when I tried to take the reigns and go to a public high school.

I'm 17 and I'm going through a sort of mini-midlife crisis right now realizing I threw my entire childhood down the shitter, partly because of suppressed shame from an autism (mis)diagnosis. I'm stoned right now so if this is awkward then I'm sorry. I'll probably be deleting this when I wake up tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to talk about the diagnosis of Asperger's/autism and why I think it's really so commonly diagnosed, and how it's actually making kids worse.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I do think Asperger's is a real disorder, but it's actually much rarer than it's made out to be. The problem isn't an increase in autism, but rather an increase in normal, socially awkward kids being misdiagnosed.\r\n\r\nAlright, with that out of the way, let's get down to business.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I *do* know what I'm doing. I know I'm weird, I could control it, but I simply don't. And I'm too embarrassed to admit it. I've been like this my whole life.  Rather than change, I simply suppressed my negative thoughts for most of my life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Asperger's diagnosis came along in 2011, I was already confused about my emotions and too frightened to admit what was going on. All the sudden, I believed I couldn't improve no matter what, and I think I just gave up. I forgot all my emotions thinking they were a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself.\r\n\r\nI was homeschooled and extremely sheltered until 2019 when I tried to take the reigns and go to a public high school. There's a big culture shock leaving the small home I was stuck in for this big, complex real world. The fact that this wasn't considered by doctors is pretty surprising, but I probably never told them how I felt in the first place knowing how shy I was.\r\n\r\nSince I was 6, I've had no joy in life. Maybe you could call it depression? I would. The world is dull, grey, numb, cold, and indifferent to me from my perspective. Nobody gives a shit about me. That's how I feel. My parents are strange and crazy enough and me, being homeschooled, had no way of realizing that (I actually did, but I think I ended up numbing myself to that early on to protect myself from the pain). My dad has always taught me to see the bad in everything. He's a miserable man.\r\n\r\nI have always been extremely passive aggressive. I think I hate my parents, but hid it so deep within my head that it fell into my subconscious for a long time.\r\n\r\nI've become so confused about my own emotions that I've lost any shred of personality I may have been able to develop, and have instead become lost in a false persona. I killed my soul, buried it, and built a new one, and I can't find a shovel to dig up the old one.\r\n\r\nI think my parents have played a huge role in all this. I still have to keep my false, naive child persona around them rather than truly mature because I cannot live with what how I've acted and how I've made a fool of myself. I did try to change somewhat in 2019, but I just can't embrace normality until I can get away from everyone who knows my past. Imagine this kid (https://youtu.be/IORGuTdpSeo) amped up by about 3 times exactly (I am being literal), and that would be me until 15 and a half. And look at the way his parents act around him (I recently rediscovered my ability to read body language after I forgot it as a preteen after years of doing nothing but using the internet), and even how they talk about him. They clearly hate him, and maybe they themselves are suppressing their hatred for him. He and I are very similar.\r\n\r\nDon't think it's all their fault though. I have always chosen vengeance, anger, and fear and the low route in general throughout my entire life. I am motivated completely by self interest because I'm too scared to see the objectifive reality and how much of a loser I really am. I am such a pussy to the point that I'm too afraid to learn from my own mistakes. Humiliation is terrifying to me.\r\nBut they did a lot to push me into this position of fearful rage.\r\n\r\nMy point is, I display many of the autistic symptoms almost by choice for some reason, and I know it's because I made so many terrible choices growing up. I've chosen to be a man child.\r\n\r\nNow, considering how typical this is unexplainably with kids today, while also considering how different the social climate is, and the fact that there are no consistent differences in the high functioning autistic brain structure compared to a normal one, I find it hard to believe this is a true neurological disorder. Instead, I believe Asperger's/High functioning autism is a new phenomenon (Strange how that behavior was so rare in the Past compared to now) caused by a generation of awkward millennial (gen y and z) children having difficulties adapting to the new mid 21st century culture while battling memories of the less cynical late 20th/early 21st century. They are so afraid and distant that they don't even want to understand why they're afraid. \r\n\r\nThere is no high functioning autism. Just unattractive (we do tend to be ugly) children with severe anxiety and a tendency towards extreme passive aggressiveness as well as roleplaying.\r\n\r\nRather than face these issues, the confused children are told it's out of their control and hopelessy choose to withdraw into a fantasy world.\r\n\r\nFor lower functioning cases, I don't have as much of a problem (there are noticeable differences in brain structure). As for high functioning autism, I think we're setting a generation up for a world of hurt.\r\n\r\nWe're not retards (no offense to the lower functioning). We're twisted and confused in our own goals and unwilling to change out of fear.\r\n\r\nI'm so distant and separate from everyone in life that I'm not entirely in reality.\r\n\r\nThe last lines of Black Sabbath's song, \"paranoid,\" really resonate with me. \"And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state, I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nIt feels too late. \r\n\r\nBut as an adult, I will be able to have a second chance. It's not over yet. I have another 10 years that have the potential to be infinitely better than the last.\r\n\r\nAutism, at least in my case, is caused by a bad mindset I've adapted over the years. And I think that's the way it is for most people \"on the spectrum\" at this point.\r\n\r\nEdit: Alright, I'm not gonna take this down. Thank you all for your support. It means a lot to me.","body_html":"<p>Hey Ruqqies.

I'm 17 and I'm going through a sort of mini-midlife crisis right now realizing I threw my entire childhood down the shitter, partly because of suppressed shame from an autism (mis)diagnosis. I'm stoned right now so if this is awkward then I'm sorry. I'll probably be deleting this when I wake up tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to talk about the diagnosis of Asperger's/autism and why I think it's really so commonly diagnosed, and how it's actually making kids worse.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I do think Asperger's is a real disorder, but it's actually much rarer than it's made out to be. The problem isn't an increase in autism, but rather an increase in normal, socially awkward kids being misdiagnosed.\r\n\r\nAlright, with that out of the way, let's get down to business.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I *do* know what I'm doing. I know I'm weird, I could control it, but I simply don't. And I'm too embarrassed to admit it. I've been like this my whole life.  Rather than change, I simply suppressed my negative thoughts for most of my life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Asperger's diagnosis came along in 2011, I was already confused about my emotions and too frightened to admit what was going on. All the sudden, I believed I couldn't improve no matter what, and I think I just gave up. I forgot all my emotions thinking they were a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself.\r\n\r\nI was homeschooled and extremely sheltered until 2019 when I tried to take the reigns and go to a public high school. There's a big culture shock leaving the small home I was stuck in for this big, complex real world. The fact that this wasn't considered by doctors is pretty surprising, but I probably never told them how I felt in the first place knowing how shy I was.\r\n\r\nSince I was 6, I've had no joy in life. Maybe you could call it depression? I would. The world is dull, grey, numb, cold, and indifferent to me from my perspective. Nobody gives a shit about me. That's how I feel. My parents are strange and crazy enough and me, being homeschooled, had no way of realizing that (I actually did, but I think I ended up numbing myself to that early on to protect myself from the pain). My dad has always taught me to see the bad in everything. He's a miserable man.\r\n\r\nI have always been extremely passive aggressive. I think I hate my parents, but hid it so deep within my head that it fell into my subconscious for a long time.\r\n\r\nI've become so confused about my own emotions that I've lost any shred of personality I may have been able to develop, and have instead become lost in a false persona. I killed my soul, buried it, and built a new one, and I can't find a shovel to dig up the old one.\r\n\r\nI think my parents have played a huge role in all this. I still have to keep my false, naive child persona around them rather than truly mature because I cannot live with what how I've acted and how I've made a fool of myself. I did try to change somewhat in 2019, but I just can't embrace normality until I can get away from everyone who knows my past. Imagine this kid (https://youtu.be/IORGuTdpSeo) amped up by about 3 times exactly (I am being literal), and that would be me until 15 and a half. And look at the way his parents act around him (I recently rediscovered my ability to read body language after I forgot it as a preteen after years of doing nothing but using the internet), and even how they talk about him. They clearly hate him, and maybe they themselves are suppressing their hatred for him. He and I are very similar.\r\n\r\nDon't think it's all their fault though. I have always chosen vengeance, anger, and fear and the low route in general throughout my entire life. I am motivated completely by self interest because I'm too scared to see the objectifive reality and how much of a loser I really am. I am such a pussy to the point that I'm too afraid to learn from my own mistakes. Humiliation is terrifying to me.\r\nBut they did a lot to push me into this position of fearful rage.\r\n\r\nMy point is, I display many of the autistic symptoms almost by choice for some reason, and I know it's because I made so many terrible choices growing up. I've chosen to be a man child.\r\n\r\nNow, considering how typical this is unexplainably with kids today, while also considering how different the social climate is, and the fact that there are no consistent differences in the high functioning autistic brain structure compared to a normal one, I find it hard to believe this is a true neurological disorder. Instead, I believe Asperger's/High functioning autism is a new phenomenon (Strange how that behavior was so rare in the Past compared to now) caused by a generation of awkward millennial (gen y and z) children having difficulties adapting to the new mid 21st century culture while battling memories of the less cynical late 20th/early 21st century. They are so afraid and distant that they don't even want to understand why they're afraid. \r\n\r\nThere is no high functioning autism. Just unattractive (we do tend to be ugly) children with severe anxiety and a tendency towards extreme passive aggressiveness as well as roleplaying.\r\n\r\nRather than face these issues, the confused children are told it's out of their control and hopelessy choose to withdraw into a fantasy world.\r\n\r\nFor lower functioning cases, I don't have as much of a problem (there are noticeable differences in brain structure). As for high functioning autism, I think we're setting a generation up for a world of hurt.\r\n\r\nWe're not retards (no offense to the lower functioning). We're twisted and confused in our own goals and unwilling to change out of fear.\r\n\r\nI'm so distant and separate from everyone in life that I'm not entirely in reality.\r\n\r\nThe last lines of Black Sabbath's song, \"paranoid,\" really resonate with me. \"And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state, I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nIt feels too late. \r\n\r\nBut as an adult, I will be able to have a second chance. It's not over yet. I have another 10 years that have the potential to be infinitely better than the last.\r\n\r\nAutism, at least in my case, is caused by a bad mindset I've adapted over the years. And I think that's the way it is for most people \"on the spectrum\" at this point.\r\n\r\nEdit: Alright, I'm not gonna take this down. Thank you all for your support.

I'm 17 and I'm going through a sort of mini-midlife crisis right now realizing I threw my entire childhood down the shitter, partly because of suppressed shame from an autism (mis)diagnosis.

The Pauline epistles, for example, almost indisputably the most popular part of the bible, were never intended for anyone except specific clusters of early believers, and much of it is subjective opinion of the author, and on top of that our current text is severely damaged by the redactors.</p>\n","created_utc":1620605485,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_xv7l","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1583035818,"description":"\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whole western Europe is being destroyed.\r\n\r\nYeah okay, countries constantly sacking each other for no reason and every one of them setting up a ruthless dictatorship is nowhere *close* to having a puny political riot every now and then.\r\n\r\n> You are right. However, now we can clearly see how the stage is getting ready to bring us the sign of the beast from revelation.\r\n\r\nYou must not think I'm right, since you go on repeating the exact same thing as they did. The truth is, everything so far that could even possibly be linked to Revelation has been extremely minor, and not localized to our time. Plus, the beast is in all likelihood Nero, which is why he is identified by the cryptic number 666, because if they identified him directly there'd be hell to pay.\r\n\r\n> the great reset\r\n\r\nWhy do you think Satan needs a great reset to conquer humanity? He had it in his grip from the beginning.\r\n\r\n> and therefore I think that the 2nd coming is really close. From things I've read about I think that the seven years from Revelation will begin during next 10 years.\r\n\r\nDoomsdayers say that every 10 years. Just like how every 12 years, the world will supposedly end in the next 12 years from global warming.\r\n\r\n> I don' believe that the 2nd coming of Jesus will be something that nobody is going to even think of happening. I think this is more about not knowing the exact date when He will come, but I'm sure that people who can see things in context will be able to guess the period of time, when it's going to happen.\r\n\r\nNow doesn't resemble the description of that time period. Well it does, but since most of the rest of history is so much worse in comparison it's far from being the biggest suspect.\r\n\r\n> I don't think you understand how that works. The delusion is aimed at people who refused to believe the truth. They are people who decided that they don't want to be saved by Jesus, so He lets them walk on that way. And it is important to point out, that God doesn't send delusion to anyone. He just wont stop the devil from overtaking these people completely.\r\n\r\nThe text you cite explicitly describes God as being the one who sends the delusion.

However, now we can clearly see how the stage is getting ready to bring us the sign of the beast from revelation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You must not think I'm right, since you go on repeating the exact same thing as they did. The truth is, everything so far that could even possibly be linked to Revelation has been extremely minor, and not localized to our time. Plus, the beast is in all likelihood Nero, which is why he is identified by the cryptic number 666, because if they identified him directly there'd be hell to pay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the great reset</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why do you think Satan needs a great reset to conquer humanity? He had it in his grip from the beginning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and therefore I think that the 2nd coming is really close.

Just like how every 12 years, the world will supposedly end in the next 12 years from global warming.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don' believe that the 2nd coming of Jesus will be something that nobody is going to even think of happening. I think this is more about not knowing the exact date when He will come, but I'm sure that people who can see things in context will be able to guess the period of time, when it's going to happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now doesn't resemble the description of that time period. Well it does, but since most of the rest of history is so much worse in comparison it's far from being the biggest suspect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't think you understand how that works. The delusion is aimed at people who refused to believe the truth. They are people who decided that they don't want to be saved by Jesus, so He lets them walk on that way. And it is important to point out, that God doesn't send delusion to anyone. He just wont stop the devil from overtaking these people completely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text you cite explicitly describes God as being the one who sends the delusion.
