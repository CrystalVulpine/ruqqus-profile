[8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mary Gardens</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Floral imagery from scripture and nature has been applied to Mary in the writings of the Church Fathers and in the liturgy, providing the foundation in tradition for the subsequent naming of hundreds of flowers for Mary's life, mysteries, virtues, excellences and divine prerogatives in the popular religious folk traditions of the medieval countrysides - as recorded by botanists, folklorists and lexicographers.[18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The practice of honoring Mary with flowers originated among monasteries and convents in medieval Europe. During the Middle Ages, people saw reminders of Mary in the flowers and herbs growing around them.[19] The first reference to an actual garden dedicated to Mary is from the life of St. Fiacre, Irish patron saint of gardening, who planted and tended a garden around the oratory to Our Lady he built at his famous hospice for the poor and infirm in France in the 7th Century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>from: <a href=\"https://infogalactic.com/info/May_devotions_to_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://infogalactic.com/info/May_devotions_to_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary</a></p>\n","comment_count":3,"created_utc":1619714426,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_avvm","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"avvm","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/avvm/catholic-devotions-to-the-blessed-virgin","score":3,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Catholic Devotions To The Blessed Virgin Mary In The Month Of May","upvotes":3,"url":""},"post_id":"avvm","score":0,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
