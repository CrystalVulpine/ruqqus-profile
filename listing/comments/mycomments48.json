There are other \"yogas\" which aren't stretching (\"karma yoga\" is a yoga of working as religious practice, or \"raja yoga\" which I think is some kind of intellectual activity). Maybe like someone might say they want to play \"Nintendo\" when they mean video games in general (actually this analogy is backwards, from a particular to a general term, whereas \"yoga\" is a general term being used for the specific term of \"hatha yoga\"). Anyway, \"hatha yoga\" isn't just stretching, but is a religious practice of hindus. So, it seems like that would be avoided by Christians as being directly non-Christian, or at least due to doubt that some kind of conflicting practice wouldn't be mixed in. \r\n\r\nNow, the only overlap I'd like to mention is, say I do a non-yoga stretch, and then it's almost the same as or is the same as some kind of yoga stretch. I imagine there are a limit of the amount of effective stretches that exist. I guess it could end up being like \"doing yoga without doing yoga\", if that makes any sense. It's not like hindus or the hindu religion get to trademark the stretches as part of their religion, and if you do a stretch that overlaps with a yoga stretch, I don't think it's yoga exactly. \r\n\r\nMeditation, or specifically \"transcendental meditation\" is a Buddhist religious practice. Sometimes, either yoga or meditation are part of other non-Christian religious traditions (New Age practice comes to mind). Again, it would seem that there could be conflicts with views here, whereas sometimes Buddhist monks might meditate for hours a day instead of pray for hours a day as Christian monks would do, due to different fundamental beliefs that lead to different actions. It seems Christians should avoid meditative practices.\r\n\r\nAnother confusion is the word \"meditation\", which in the West is used to mean \"meditative prayer\", which is something different entirely. (For the Catholic view, see [\"mental prayer\" on the prayer encyclopedia entry](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm)). I suspect the buddhist word of \"meditation\" may be a deliberately chosen confused translation, but I don't really know for sure, if anyone has any knowledge on the history of translating the word.\r\n\r\nAs with yoga, meditation seems to have an overlap with non-meditative relaxation. It's not exactly the same as meditation to close your eyes, relax, take some deep breaths, and clear your mind, or \"zone out\" - although these seem to overlap with Buddhist meditation. Again, I don't think Buddhists have a \"trademark\" on relaxation, but it seems the Eastern tradition has made it in to a major practice of their religion.\r\n\r\nI think it has been concerning to see yoga and meditation casually suggested as \"therapies\" for those with mental issues today; it seems to create more and more of divides between Christian and non-Christian society (although there are some non-Christian therapists who might have the open mind enough to understand a potential conflict exists between these suggestions and the faith of a Christian patient).\r\n\r\nNow, on the other hand, Christianity has had a tendency to \"baptize\" certain things (to take a non-Christian thing and make it in to a Christian thing), so I don't know if that could be done with yoga and meditation, but I don't think it has been done at present.

There are other \"yogas\" which aren't stretching (\"karma yoga\" is a yoga of working as religious practice, or \"raja yoga\" which I think is some kind of intellectual activity).

Anyway, \"hatha yoga\" isn't just stretching, but is a religious practice of hindus.

Sometimes, either yoga or meditation are part of other non-Christian religious traditions (New Age practice comes to mind).

(For the Catholic view, see [\"mental prayer\" on the prayer encyclopedia entry](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm)). I suspect the buddhist word of \"meditation\" may be a deliberately chosen confused translation, but I don't really know for sure, if anyone has any knowledge on the history of translating the word.\r\n\r\nAs with yoga, meditation seems to have an overlap with non-meditative relaxation. It's not exactly the same as meditation to close your eyes, relax, take some deep breaths, and clear your mind, or \"zone out\" - although these seem to overlap with Buddhist meditation.

Joan of Arc famously cross-dressed, wearing men’s armor in the 15th century as a deterrent to rape (and was eventually burned at the stake in part because of this). By 1850, Amelia Bloomer, a women’s rights activist, popularized the “bloomer” pant, those baggy, knee- or ankle-length trousers Elizabeth Smith Miller created. By the 20th century, women’s pants were appropriate for “occasional dressing only,” worn at designated times as hostess pajamas or bicycling pants, Emma McClendon, associate costume curator at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. By the 1920s and 30s, celebrities like Marlene Dietrich dared to wear full pantsuits to movie premieres (Dietrich’s came courtesy Gabrielle Chanel), and the “most daring thing about Katharine Hepburn” was her pants.\n\n> McClendon points out that as celebrities, both of those women could get away with wearing androgynous looks without repercussions, while ordinary women elsewhere would have been fined, thanks to laws enacted by men. In France, women needed permission to “dress like a man” to work or ride bicycles or horses, a law that remained intact until 2013 (though it hadn’t been seriously enforced in more than a century.) In 1939, a Los Angeles woman went to jail for wearing slacks to court, the judge citing them as a distraction from the ongoing legal business at hand. Women in the United States Congress were barred from wearing pants on the Senate floor until the 1993 “Pantsuit Rebellion” overturned the archaic rule.\n\n> It’d be naive to think women’s garb isn’t policed in the new millennia: In 2009, a Sudanese woman was fined (but avoided whipping) for wearing green slacks, which violated “public decency laws”; a rule adopted in 2017 for women pro golfers stipulated they could be fined for wearing leggings; and, speaking of leggings, some now see them as the anti-pants pants — as oppressive as corsets and gowns, according to one New York Times opinion writer, whose recent “yoga pants are bad for women” Op-Ed ignited controversy around the matter. You get the idea.\n\nAgain as history.com notes, Joan of Arc was [put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft and violating divine law for dressing like a man](https://www.history.com/news/joan-arc-burned-stake) - so it was seen for a long time as being wrong for women to dress like men (and wearing pants would probably fall in to being a violation of that).\n\n> And why doesn't the same principle apply for men?\n\nIf it doesn't apply, it may be because there is a legit double standard and women and men are different.
