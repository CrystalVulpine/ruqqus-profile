But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.” (Matthew 19:8-9)\n\"If a man marries a woman but she does not please him, having discovered something wrong with her, he writes a document of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house. When she leaves his house, she is free to marry another man.\" (Deuteronomy 24:1-2)</p>\n<p>\"But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all… all you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\" (Matthew 5:34, 37)\n\"Fear the Lord your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name.\" (Deuteronomy 6:13)</p>\n<p>\"Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.” (John 5:8-10)\n\"While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.” So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord commanded Moses.\"\n(Numbers 15:32, 35-36)</p>\n<p>There are many others obviously... I think Jesus depicts the true nature of God vs what the old testament portrays Him as... I'm not sure that I believe most of what God does in the Old Testament.</p>\n","created_utc":1617200421,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_uq5g","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"uq5g","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":10,"parent_comment_id":["uq2s"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/932d/lord-and-satan/uq5g","post_id":"932d","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["uq5g"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/932d/lord-and-satan/uqi3","post":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"(2 Samuel 24:1) Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”\r\n\r\n(1 Chronicles 21:1) Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.\r\n\r\nThey are both the same story as David takes a census of his people.

And Isaiah actually speaks that the Gentiles may end up being blessed more in some circumstances than the Israelites, but that the treasures of the Gentiles would provide for Jerusalem as the city of Zion. The Gentiles would become an extension of God's hands as the Israelites were prior to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Remember also that not all Israelites were the children of David, and God specifically seeks to bless the children of David because he promised his servant David that his kin would rule the world. That was the tribe of Judah, which was kept in Jerusalem while the rest of the tribes were scattered. But he told Judah that while Judah would be preserved, it would always be a lesser power on God's Earth. Always subservient to Israelites elsewhere. It's why Jerusalem is still a lesser power riding on the coattails of other Christian nations. And other Christian nations provide their treaures to build the walls of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>But as God said to Judah, they would be amongst the most rebellious people to God. They would be regarded as corrupted silver.</p>\n<p>The Bible don't lie, bruh. God knows everything and tells us.</p>\n","created_utc":1617122077,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_un1w","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"un1w","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/92r7/what-if-israel-had-repented-and/un1w","post_id":"92r7","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["un1w"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/92r7/what-if-israel-had-repented-and/uojn","post":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"Just spit-balling, but...\r\n\r\nI do not think God necessarily anticipated the rejection of Christ until the coming days to His crucifixion.
