This became a little more apparent as I grew, developed a higher understanding, and even just a more advanced reading level.</p>\n<p>I don't discount the NIV, but perhaps just from my own experience, I view it as a \"beginner's Bible\" for a younger audience. There are plenty of Bible versions that came into existence that would deem as outright wrong (literally Bibles where they introduced cussing and swearing to appeal to prisoners, etc.), and I in no way would ever categorize the NIV into that group, but there is enough discomfort that I personally avoid it when given a choice. I would recommend a few other versions/translations before recommending the NIV.</p>\n","created_utc":1616983302,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_uhuo","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"uhuo","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["uhrx"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/914r/best-bible-version-in-your-opinion/uhuo","post_id":"914r","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["uhuo"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/914r/best-bible-version-in-your-opinion/uklc","post":{"author_name":"TooControversialForReddit","award_count":0,"body":"*","body_html":"<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n","comment_count":36,"created_utc":1616973986,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_914r","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"914r","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/914r/best-bible-version-in-your-opinion","score":11,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Best bible version in your opinion?","upvotes":10,"url":""},"post_id":"914r","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
