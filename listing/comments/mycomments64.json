I don't think you can be blamed for impulses but watching real videos of real people being sexualized isn't much different than prostitution.\r\n\r\n> you aren't even a christian\r\n\r\nYou keep saying that even though I am.\r\n\r\n> Your insistence that I read scripture and your quotes of scripture are humorous and silly! It would be like me thinking I could tell a brain surgeon how to perform a surgery simply because I've read a bunch of books and know the history of the medical profession. Sure I might know a lot, but the meat of knowledge, the know how, the understanding would not be there.\r\n\r\nSo you're basically just going to ignore it because you don't like that it doesn't align with your selfish values. I agree the bible isn't always accurate but this teaching fits with the overall God-given principle. You seem to be motivated more by a desire that everyone should be exactly like you.\r\n\r\n> You lack the Holy spirit and by the things you post I can see you detest him! The questions you post and your comments are the words of one who knows God is real but hates Him, so time is spent trying to convince others to hate Him as well.\r\n\r\nI never denied God was real nor do I detest him. What I detest is people doing evil in God's name. People using \"God\" as an excuse to demand special treatment for themselves while mistreating others. Do you know who the Pharisees and Sadducees were?\r\n\r\n> Loaded with tons of \"gotcha\" catch phrases and little bits of scripture, its cute.\r\n\r\nThat's what *you* do with your \"proof texts\" to support your crazy doctrines such as women should be nothing but pieces of meat at mens' disposal. I can't speak for you but in my experience people saying those things do that, quote little bits from Paul's letters (most of which aren't even really his) and a few other pieces and twist it any way they want to. And rarely ever giving the gospels, the literal words of Jesus, any attention.\r\n\r\n> without the imbuing of the Holy spirit you will never grasp an understanding of scripture, and you should be summarily ignored.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, I understand it much better than I used to, when I was like you, when I fell for all these lies of TV preachers and political theology. The Holy Spirit taught me far more clearly.

I agree the bible isn't always accurate but this teaching fits with the overall God-given principle.

What I detest is people doing evil in God's name. People using \"God\" as an excuse to demand special treatment for themselves while mistreating others. Do you know who the Pharisees and Sadducees were?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Loaded with tons of \"gotcha\" catch phrases and little bits of scripture, its cute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what <em>you</em> do with your \"proof texts\" to support your crazy doctrines such as women should be nothing but pieces of meat at mens' disposal. I can't speak for you but in my experience people saying those things do that, quote little bits from Paul's letters (most of which aren't even really his) and a few other pieces and twist it any way they want to.
