The most basic example of loving someone by telling them the truth, is telling them if there is a booger hanging out of their nose rather than letting them go on their day looking foolish. But of course, most boogers are much harder to explain to people, boogers like greed and pride and our sinful nature.\r\n\r\nSo if love includes telling people the truth, what is *the* truth?

Did you guys know that there are numerous other people who came both before and after Jesus, claiming to be the messiah? Jesus himself referenced them, Gamliel referenced them, and a quick google search will yield a list of those who have come after him, though the list of those before seems harder to find, likely lost in time.\r\n\r\nWhat distinction can be made between Jesus and these other tens, maybe hundreds of people who claimed to be the Jewish messiah? That all of the others came to nothing; almost as though God not only lifted up Jesus, but also put down all other false messiahs, and brought them to nought, as described by Gamaliel in Acts 5:33:\r\n\r\n>When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. \r\n\r\n>And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. \r\n\r\n>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found to fight against God.”\r\n\r\nHere some 2000 years later, and Jesus' prophecy that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his church still stands true, however weak the body may be after millennia of persecution and tribulation, in Matthew 16:18:\r\n\r\n>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, **and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.**\r\n\r\nSo, how is it that all other religions have had such weak ripples, Jewish messiahs specifically have had almost no success, as though they only threw a pebble into a pond, but Jesus has seemingly thrown a mountain into a sea? How could this be? \r\n\r\nCan this be attributed to our \"reptile\" overlords, as many assert? That religion is a tool to control the population? Did Satan come up with the idea of moral perfection, the pursuit of righteousness, and faith in God, and eternal life, all in an effort to control those very people that he already had control of as he saw fit?\r\n\r\n*Can* these concepts be made up? How often do you speak with trouble makers, ungodly folk, and they try to subvert you into behaving perfectly, righteously, and virtuously? Even most \"pastors\" I speak to do not encourage such behavior. Why? How can the bible be so \"popular\" but nobody actually takes it seriously? \r\n\r\nJesus asked (Luke 6:46), why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?\r\n\r\nYou might want to think long and hard about whether you really love God or not.  Not just if you want to love him, but if you really love him. If you really recognize him as who he claims to be, the creator of heaven and earth. Imagine claiming to recognize someone as the creator of heaven and earth, but still thinking you know better than him. \"I know Jesus said not to do that but it's okay, he will forgive me.\"  MY FRIEND, have you not received forgiveness already??
