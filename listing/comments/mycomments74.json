It's a nasty role and not very fun but someone has to do it. Males lose their childhood \"sponge\" learning and enormous creativity over time in exchange for physio-spatial skills, while girls develop them further. You may wonder why one sex is more well rounded and the other overspecializes so much in just this one area, but in ancient times physical strength was a BIG deal. But it is a fact that male brains are designed to be good at perceiving pain, becoming angry and demanding justice, and noticing moving objects, and female brains are designed to be good at logic, creativity, and nurturing, and considering the historical roles of each, this setup makes perfect sense, fair or not.\r\n\r\nThere is a common misconception that males are more variable and excel both at being god awful at something or insanely good, while women are more centered around the average. Males being more variable is true, however technically female abilities average far higher than male ones, as shown by brain scans. The reason they often don't achieve as much is that men are more competitive and more likely to try and turn a hobby into a career or financial success, whereas women tend to do things more just for fun in private. The other reason is that, also due to primal instincts, society coddles girls and is too harsh on boys. Boys, even from a young age, must NEVER cry, NEVER fail, NEVER make mistakes, etc. while girls are allowed to basically have temper tantrums over the smallest things and be comparatively lazy (as they are not required to provide for themselves like men). What this results in is that boys are constantly worrying about doing their job well enough, while girls concern themselves with gossip and makeup which of course is going to make them stupid; the fact that they maintain average intelligence doing this is amazing. However, the ones that have enough interest to push themselves even a little bit are fucking savants; the highest IQ on record is in fact a woman's. This reflects my personal experience pretty well also, if you ask for 10 geniuses, you'll get 9 men but one girl who is more brilliant than half of them combined. Female is definitely the superior sex when it comes to natural talent, you'll see a man talented in one or two things every once in a while but the *majority* of girls have a ton of talents, some seem to be talented at every single thing there is; whether they tend use them or waste them is another story.","body_html":"<p>Hate to burst your pride bubble but pretty much anything that isn't physio-spatial women have so much more potential.

I do however think that Paul's authentic letters are valuable as they give good insight to the very early Christian world from before the gospels were even written, so he counts as an early witness like the authors of the gospels, albeit in a different form. The Pauline epistles can also be useful for detecting later edits to the text of the gospels. And Paul is also a trustworthy man of high understanding when read correctly, and while not our teacher is well worth listening to.</p>\n","created_utc":1613359586,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_qt2q","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/bible/banner-1.png","color":"#30409F","created_utc":1593065817,"description":"About The Holy Bible - Scripture, Bible Study, Bible Stories...","description_html":"<p>About The Holy Bible - Scripture, Bible Study, Bible Stories...</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_1by","id":"1by","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Bible","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Bible","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/bible/profile-1.png"},"guild_id":"1by","herald_guild":null,"id":"qt2q","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent":{"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"All epistles are unnecessary - why rely on the words of mere humans when God has Himself revealed scripture that is His own?","body_html":"<p>All epistles are unnecessary - why rely on the words of mere humans when God has Himself revealed scripture that is His own?</p>\n","created_utc":1613358917,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_qt1v","guild_id":"1by","herald_guild":null,"id":"qt1v","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+Bible/post/7my5/1-2-timothy-and-titus-why/qt1v","post_id":"7my5","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["qt1v"],"permalink":"/+Bible/post/7my5/1-2-timothy-and-titus-why/qt2q","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"The pastoral epistles, known to most as 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus, were not written by Paul but forged in his name by the church fathers who sought to combat an early heretic named Marcion.
