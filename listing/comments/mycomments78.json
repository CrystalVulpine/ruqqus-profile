I have only heard it in MGTOW circles and it seems like historical revisionism. I like MGTOW but only as a life that is brought on by modern conditions making marriage impossible, not out of a rejection of marriage that considers it inherently a bad thing (merely \"the plantation\" rather than the fundamentally necessary bond that builds families and therefore society). \n\nI think this MGTOW view camd about because some relationships are nightmares today, so then some people concluded, \"and you know what, it was never that good to begin with!\" That's a bit of a jump there though in thinking.\n\nThere is the belief that the traditional way is the only way - there's no real alternative option, so whether it is unfair or not is kind of beside the point. Sure, in some ways it is unfair, and in many ways today life is unfair to both men and women.\n\nThe MGTOW view also seems to be inherently atheistic. Men are rewarded for their work in this life or the next. If women do not work as much in this life, then there is less reward for them in the afterlife. But there is plenty of work for traditional women, it's just \"women's work\" rather than men's work. Sure, life may be a \"rip off\" for some men if they dont believe in an afterlife and arent rewarded for some efforts made in this life.\n\nYou were traditionally allowed to have emotions and problems. Maybe not in all environments but that is the same as today, you just needed and need to find people to confide in.\n\nMen only had the option to go to school and get a job.

I have only heard it in MGTOW circles and it seems like historical revisionism. I like MGTOW but only as a life that is brought on by modern conditions making marriage impossible, not out of a rejection of marriage that considers it inherently a bad thing (merely \"the plantation\" rather than the fundamentally necessary bond that builds families and therefore society).</p>\n<p>I think this MGTOW view camd about because some relationships are nightmares today, so then some people concluded, \"and you know what, it was never that good to begin with!\" That's a bit of a jump there though in thinking.</p>\n<p>There is the belief that the traditional way is the only way - there's no real alternative option, so whether it is unfair or not is kind of beside the point. Sure, in some ways it is unfair, and in many ways today life is unfair to both men and women.</p>\n<p>The MGTOW view also seems to be inherently atheistic. Men are rewarded for their work in this life or the next. If women do not work as much in this life, then there is less reward for them in the afterlife. But there is plenty of work for traditional women, it's just \"women's work\" rather than men's work.
