In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys.

Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies.

Yeah I do that too. Even talking about it now could be considered combative. It's such a primal instinct that it's difficult to even realize when you're doing it. I think the only solution is to always take a few steps back and try to consider where the other person is coming from rather than rushing to shove ourselves in their face.\r\n\r\n2. I'm not aware of any political parties doing good. I don't even think that's *possible*. This world is run by satan and the ones who want to control people (which is what politics is really) will of course always be the ones running politics. There's nothing wrong with criticizing a political movement but you should never align and submit to a particular platform. What we're seeing right now is a faction of the republican party pretty much running the churches (democrats sometimes too but that's nowhere near as common as they openly hate Christians). I've noticed that whenever the conservative belief contradicts Christianity they will nearly always opt for the former, which is a red flag that they may not actually be true believers and merely use \"God\" as a political tool. This is REALLY bad. \"You shall not bear the name of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your god for falsehood\" (Exodus 20:7). (I am not accusing anyone of this, it is merely a suspicion of mine that this is a growing problem). In some ways they have strayed very far from the faith. We were never commanded to support any political party, and in aligning with worldly movements we are effectively making ourselves friends of the world, which makes enmity with God.\r\n\r\n3. Mostly because they're taught that they're just always right all their lives and never really stop to think about it or ponder it. Infants in Christ.\r\n\r\n4. Even more rampant than divorce is pride. Self-righteous behavior, virtue signaling, bragging about good works, etc. it's all \"we're better than you unbelievers\" like the freemasons do with their \"making good men better\" clubs. Definitely not what we're supposed to be doing, and that's all half the churches are nowadays. A close second is wrath and unwillingness to forgive. Well, at least for *certain* things, some of which are completely made up. No one bats an eye at other serious things like lying, gossiping, divorce, pride, hate, revenge, etc. and even encourages them. Unless they're the victims of it, of course, *then* it's a problem.\r\n\r\n5. This is true but lately a lot of churches have become almost all about that. A lot of church services now are nothing but \"this is the outsiders and we don't do all the stuff they're doing because we're better than them\".

I think the only solution is to always take a few steps back and try to consider where the other person is coming from rather than rushing to shove ourselves in their face.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm not aware of any political parties doing good. I don't even think that's <em>possible</em>. This world is run by satan and the ones who want to control people (which is what politics is really) will of course always be the ones running politics. There's nothing wrong with criticizing a political movement but you should never align and submit to a particular platform. What we're seeing right now is a faction of the republican party pretty much running the churches (democrats sometimes too but that's nowhere near as common as they openly hate Christians). I've noticed that whenever the conservative belief contradicts Christianity they will nearly always opt for the former, which is a red flag that they may not actually be true believers and merely use \"God\" as a political tool. This is REALLY bad. \"You shall not bear the name of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your god for falsehood\" (Exodus 20:7). (I am not accusing anyone of this, it is merely a suspicion of mine that this is a growing problem). In some ways they have strayed very far from the faith. We were never commanded to support any political party, and in aligning with worldly movements we are effectively making ourselves friends of the world, which makes enmity with God.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mostly because they're taught that they're just always right all their lives and never really stop to think about it or ponder it. Infants in Christ.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even more rampant than divorce is pride. Self-righteous behavior, virtue signaling, bragging about good works, etc. it's all \"we're better than you unbelievers\" like the freemasons do with their \"making good men better\" clubs. Definitely not what we're supposed to be doing, and that's all half the churches are nowadays. A close second is wrath and unwillingness to forgive. Well, at least for <em>certain</em> things, some of which are completely made up. No one bats an eye at other serious things like lying, gossiping, divorce, pride, hate, revenge, etc. and even encourages them. Unless they're the victims of it, of course, <em>then</em> it's a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is true but lately a lot of churches have become almost all about that. A lot of church services now are nothing but \"this is the outsiders and we don't do all the stuff they're doing because we're better than them\". They do it to elevate themselves, and not for the purpose of warnning people about those who are untrustworthy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","created_utc":1612293920,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_pn5z","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1583035818,"description":"\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

I try not to be so reactionary to text posts, but even I fail most of the time. The solution may be to read a comment a few times and try to have a better understanding, or just to try and hear it in our heads as not being combatitive.\n\n2. Commenting on politics: This is malarkey. Yeah Jesus and Paul didn't speak much about politics because their cause was not political but spiritual. That doesn't mean that we as christians shouldn't speak against a political party that is doing evil and speak up for one that is doing good. I've long held that lack of political involvement has lead us to where we are now in America, in a position where the godless run academia, big tech, the media and the government. Stop backing down from politics, but learn to control being hot-headed about it, which can lead to going off the rails and give christians a bad name.\n\n3. Handling conflict poorly: I would venture to say that many christians have no idea how to handle conflict in a productive manner. We either avoid it altogether or try to run someone over because we can't figure out any other argument except, \"The bible is right\" and \"Jesus is lord\". Though these are truthful the unsaved have no concept of why they should ascribe to these same things.\n\n4. Ranking sin selectively: Yes the church needs to get this under control, but the modern church also needs a refresher on what actual sin is, since many have no idea. Divorce is rampant and widely accepted in the Western church while even looking at a woman and thinking she looks nice is considered sin. Likely this will never be adjusted on a wide scale.\n\n5. Judging outsiders: We are not called to judge the unsaved but to wisely cast judgement on those who call themselves part of the body. However this doesn't mean that we cannot make judgements on the behavior of \"outsiders\" and determine that they are doing good or ill and then make judgements based on that. Do you want to associate with that person? Do you trust that person? You cannot judge the status of their salvation but you most certainly can, and should, judge the content of their character.\n\nOverall an interesting read, but it seems a little whiney to me.","body_html":"<p>TLDR and my commentary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Being weird online: Yeah I can get behind this.

I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas. All across the board it's been shown that girls are substantially better learners than boys, and have sharper and more active minds. Girls also have a *significant* advantage in the arts, languages, music, humanities, even just simple functions like memory and emotion. While still having a slight advantage even in \"male\" subjects like STEM. Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better.

Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically.

Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas.

Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically.

Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies.
