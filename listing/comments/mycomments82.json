The Church that existed apart from any denominations. That which was preserved from Apostolic succession, which is the transferring of the Holy Spirit from one bishop or presbyter to another via the laying of hands, which is described in Acts 1:20-26 and in the “forgery” 1 Timothy 4:14 (which even if it were a forgery, it still describes the practices and beliefs of the Christians during the time in which it was written [A.D. 53-A.D. 63).\r\n\r\nWhat church is described in Acts? I don't see ANY reference to a church in Acts 1 or 2, unless you say the body of believers is a church which just isn't so. I'm not really sure what the point of replacing Judas that way was either, as we can see by the time Paul started his work this system was already broken down with Paul, Barnabas, everyone in Romans 16, and Luke (the author of Acts) all being considered apostles, and arguably followers outside the twelve during Jesus's ministry too. The truth is \"apostle\" just means messenger and the exact distinction of \"the twelve\" is unclear. Of course translators choose to transliterate it as a title instead, which creates much confusion. In any case, I'm not aware of any existing apostles council today.\r\n\r\n> This doesn’t do anything to disprove that the Church is the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4:1-16) or the Light and Pillar of Truth (1 Timothy 3:15), which entails it being an organized and structured entity or assemblage. The function of the Church, moreover, is conciliar, meaning that disagreements, pressing concerns, and heresies are sorted out within councils presided over by bishops (such as James [Bishop of Jerusalem] and Peter [Bishop of Antioch and later Rome]), elders, and apostles (such as the aforementioned two) as is demonstrated in Acts 15.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 12 is about the body and spiritual gifts. Not a church institution. Acts 15 appears to be merely a gathering as random Pharisee believers are participating, and Peter is merely giving his opinion (which is then agreed on).\r\n\r\n> This may be proven to be authentic because of the controversies which abounded about it during the late first millennium, and how the Western half of the Church began to interpret this as a prooftext for Papal Supremacy, while the Eastern half always held that it referred to the Apostolic authority of the clergy, conferred by the Holy Spirit, and the powers they received thereby. It does not make Peter a god, but merely again upholds the authority which the Church has because of Christ and the Holy Spirit, which Christ declares in John 20:22-23, “...Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.” Not they in and of themselves, of course, but the Holy Spirit through them.\r\n\r\nJohn 20:22-23 is also likely a later addition, because it interrupts the flow of the text, is written in a different style than the rest of the gospel, and doesn't line up with the other teachings. Elsewhere we are taught that man does not have the power to forgive for God. This would've occurred before eastern/western split so just because they're both on board with it doesn't mean it's legit. It may also denote declaring forgiveness as believers and not actually doing it, which is common in the bible.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, that is why the councils and dogmas of the Church are so important, because they sort out these issues and proclaim what is and isn’t the Truth, from scripture and tradition (2 Thessalonians 2:15).\r\n\r\nTraditions of men are *dis*couraged everywhere in the gospels. The argument of who wrote 2 Thessalonians aside, Paul often uses a word \"traditions\" which is probably more accurately either \"instructions\" or \"teachings\".\r\n\r\n> No. “Saint” derives from the Latin word, sanctus, which can mean “venerable,” “divine,” “blessed,” or “holy.” In Greek, it is agios, meaning “holy.” The reason certain individuals are granted the appellate “saint” is to indicate the status they have achieved as exemplars and defenders of the Faith unto all of us. They are holy even as He is holy, perfect even as he is perfect (Matthew 5:48), and are par takers of the Divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). They do not ever take the place of God. Certain theologians in the first millennium, anticipating objections like this, endeavor to stress the nuance in Greek between the two forms of devotion evinced by the words latreia and dulia; the former being equated in English with the word, “veneration,” due to Saints, relics, and such, and the second being equated with “worship” proper, due to God alone. Further explanation would involve some deep theology which is irrelevant to the topic at hand. Now, the word “saint” is used abundantly within the Bible to refer to God’s children, those who are saved, both in the Old and New Testaments, being translated from “קדוש, qadosh“ in the Hebrew Old Testament, and “άγιος, agios” in the Greek Old Testament and New Testament. It serves to set aside such holy people as being sanctified and special before God as those who are His chosen people and are saved. Verses containing these words include, but are not limited to, Psalm 50, 106, 116, 132, etc., Daniel 7:22, Romans 12:13, Ephesians 3:18, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's used as an adjective to describe a person, not a title that is used as a part of their name.\r\n\r\n> You obviously missed what I said about the undue tension between faith and works and what James is actually about. Faith alone cannot save, and neither can works. The two words “faith” and “alone” are not used in that context in the Bible except to say that we are not justified by faith alone (James 2:25). Let me give you a hypothetical example: I could be the most vocal person on the face of the Earth about my faith in Jesus and how I am saved, yet I could also be the most self-centered and sedentary man on Earth, doing absolutely nothing to act upon my faith, yet I still claim to have faith. This is the purpose of the epistle of James (which is thought to be earliest book written in the Old Testament and has never been considered pseudepigraphical by any mainstream early, early-modern, or contemporary Christian theologian), to exhort is to accompany our faith with works, that is why James says “not by faith only”. For if I regarded my faith in that way, then I would be perfectly described by James 2:19. Many areas in Paul’s epistles also state that we are “created in Christ Jesus for good works (Ephesians 2:10),” that “faith working through love” is sufficient (Galatians 5:6), and that we are to “work out [our] own salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12).” Now of course, works do not save us, as that would render faith and the work of Christ worthless. For our own righteousness, as Isaiah 64:6 says, “are as filthy rags.” Within the two verses before Eph. 2:10, Paul writes that we are saved by faith, which is a gift of God, and of course you know that Galatians 1-5 concerns this subject, that works do not save us. But you notice that these passages about faith are often accompanied with a statement about works and vice versa, to the extent that it may appear to be a contradiction to some. But again, as I said the first time, this arises from the false dialectic which arises between faith and works within western Christian soteriology; I will say again that in order for one to have true faith, it must produce works, otherwise it is dead. In order for one to produce true works, they must be done out of faith in God, otherwise they are worthless.\r\n\r\nThe gospels and real Paul were very clear about faith alone. True faith results in works or the desire to do good works but this is merely evidence and the result of faith. Works were never a condition of salvation and if they were, where is the life rubric? Faith alone saves. Think of all the people who changed their minds at the very end of their lives without the opportunity for works (including baptism!). Remember the thief on the cross, Nebuchadnezzar and countless others. And if works were a condition then *no one* would be saved, I can promise you that. That's the whole reason someone else had to do it for us and I think you can guess who that is.\r\n\r\n> This is a good opportunity to ask a question.

The Church that existed apart from any denominations. That which was preserved from Apostolic succession, which is the transferring of the Holy Spirit from one bishop or presbyter to another via the laying of hands, which is described in Acts 1:20-26 and in the “forgery” 1 Timothy 4:14 (which even if it were a forgery, it still describes the practices and beliefs of the Christians during the time in which it was written [A.D. 53-A.D. 63).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What church is described in Acts? I don't see ANY reference to a church in Acts 1 or 2, unless you say the body of believers is a church which just isn't so. I'm not really sure what the point of replacing Judas that way was either, as we can see by the time Paul started his work this system was already broken down with Paul, Barnabas, everyone in Romans 16, and Luke (the author of Acts) all being considered apostles, and arguably followers outside the twelve during Jesus's ministry too. The truth is \"apostle\" just means messenger and the exact distinction of \"the twelve\" is unclear. Of course translators choose to transliterate it as a title instead, which creates much confusion. In any case, I'm not aware of any existing apostles council today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This doesn’t do anything to disprove that the Church is the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4:1-16) or the Light and Pillar of Truth (1 Timothy 3:15), which entails it being an organized and structured entity or assemblage. The function of the Church, moreover, is conciliar, meaning that disagreements, pressing concerns, and heresies are sorted out within councils presided over by bishops (such as James [Bishop of Jerusalem] and Peter [Bishop of Antioch and later Rome]), elders, and apostles (such as the aforementioned two) as is demonstrated in Acts 15.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>1 Corinthians 12 is about the body and spiritual gifts. Not a church institution. Acts 15 appears to be merely a gathering as random Pharisee believers are participating, and Peter is merely giving his opinion (which is then agreed on).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This may be proven to be authentic because of the controversies which abounded about it during the late first millennium, and how the Western half of the Church began to interpret this as a prooftext for Papal Supremacy, while the Eastern half always held that it referred to the Apostolic authority of the clergy, conferred by the Holy Spirit, and the powers they received thereby. It does not make Peter a god, but merely again upholds the authority which the Church has because of Christ and the Holy Spirit, which Christ declares in John 20:22-23, “...Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.” Not they in and of themselves, of course, but the Holy Spirit through them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>John 20:22-23 is also likely a later addition, because it interrupts the flow of the text, is written in a different style than the rest of the gospel, and doesn't line up with the other teachings. Elsewhere we are taught that man does not have the power to forgive for God. This would've occurred before eastern/western split so just because they're both on board with it doesn't mean it's legit. It may also denote declaring forgiveness as believers and not actually doing it, which is common in the bible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, that is why the councils and dogmas of the Church are so important, because they sort out these issues and proclaim what is and isn’t the Truth, from scripture and tradition (2 Thessalonians 2:15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Traditions of men are <em>dis</em>couraged everywhere in the gospels.

Sure, certain issues were settled at local councils in their canons or by the orders of a bishop, yet more controversial ones, such as Gnosticism, Arianism, Nestorianism, or Iconoclasm, were eventually dealt with in the Ecumenical councils, which were codified by prayer, fasting, and studying scripture and the general teachings of the preceding fathers. That is also how the complete canon of the Bible came to be.\r\n\r\n> \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

I do not say that authorities in the Church cannot make mistakes and even commit blasphemy. They are still human after all.  That is a principal reason why we have the Holy Spirit: so that we have “eyes to see and ears to hear”, and know who does and does not speak the truth, and reprove them if need be. Yet the purpose of the Holy Spirit is to be the Guide unto all Truth within the Church, and if the Church apostatized after the death of the last Apostle, as I reckon you assume, then Christ would be a liar and the Holy Spirit either evil or nonexistent. Moreover, to illustrate, if there were a room full of people who all disagreed with one another: Jim saying that he denies the divinity of Christ; Jill saying that she is a manifestation of Christ; and Bob saying that Christ is the Son of God, the second Person of the Trinity, and yet they all claim that a single Spirit led them to those conclusions, then the Holy Spirit would be a relativistic leader, and truth would no longer be meaningful. Therefore, that is why the councils and dogmas of the Church are so important, because they sort out these issues and proclaim what is and isn’t the Truth, from scripture *and* tradition (2 Thessalonians 2:15).\r\n\r\n> I'm skeptical of all these early church saints because they often contradict Jesus and some of them seem like they had an agenda or were agents of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\nFirstly, that seems unlikely since they proved what they discoursed about from Jesus and the Old Testament. Secondly, that seems honestly even more unlikely since all they endeavored to do was uphold the doctrines that they were taught from the Apostles, and were all martyred for treason against the Roman state because they refused to give up their faith and sacrifice to the gods or burn incense to the emperor.\r\n\r\n> Not even the disciples who had physically been with Jesus for 3 years could agree on major issues, let alone them. \r\n\r\nThat is the purpose of discourse and councils, to resolve disagreements and controversies, as in Acts 15.\r\n\r\n> Also calling people \"saint\" is pretty much idolatry and judging in place of God. I'm not aware of anyone in the bible ever addressing people with that title, not even in later forgeries like the pastoral epistles.\r\n\r\nNo. “Saint” derives from the Latin word, *sanctus*, which can mean “venerable,” “divine,” “blessed,” or “holy.” In Greek, it is *agios*, meaning “holy.” The reason certain individuals are granted the appellate “saint” is to indicate the status they have achieved as exemplars and defenders of the Faith unto all of us. They are holy even as He is holy, perfect even as he is perfect (Matthew 5:48), and are par takers of the Divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). They do not *ever* take the place of God.

In the gospels and authentic letters discernment is not encouraged only for \"special\" people, in fact the people, including the \"perfect\" disciples, are repeatedly rebuked for not doing so as if it should go without saying.\r\n\r\nYes this is somewhat true. This was covered above.\r\n\r\n> The gospels and Paul's actual letters are both extremely clear that it is NOT works. They encourage good works and seem to expect that believers will desire to do so, but are adamant that faith alone is what does it. \r\n\r\nYou obviously missed what I said about the undue tension between faith and works and what James is actually about.

I'm not aware of anyone in the bible ever addressing people with that title, not even in later forgeries like the pastoral epistles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. “Saint” derives from the Latin word, <em>sanctus</em>, which can mean “venerable,” “divine,” “blessed,” or “holy.” In Greek, it is <em>agios</em>, meaning “holy.” The reason certain individuals are granted the appellate “saint” is to indicate the status they have achieved as exemplars and defenders of the Faith unto all of us. They are holy even as He is holy, perfect even as he is perfect (Matthew 5:48), and are par takers of the Divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). They do not <em>ever</em> take the place of God. Certain theologians in the first millennium, anticipating objections like this, endeavor to stress the nuance in Greek between the two forms of devotion evinced by the words <em>latreia</em> and <em>dulia</em>; the former being equated in English with the word, “veneration,” due to Saints, relics, and such, and the second being equated with “worship” proper, due to God alone. Further explanation would involve some deep theology which is irrelevant to the topic at hand. Now, the word “saint” is used abundantly within the Bible to refer to God’s children, those who are saved, both in the Old and New Testaments, being translated from “קדוש, <em>qadosh</em>“ in the Hebrew Old Testament, and “άγιος, <em>agios</em>” in the Greek Old Testament and New Testament. It serves to set aside such holy people as being sanctified and special before God as those who are His chosen people and are saved. Verses containing these words include, but are not limited to, Psalm 50, 106, 116, 132, etc., Daniel 7:22, Romans 12:13, Ephesians 3:18, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't you need your own discernment to determine who was led by the Holy Spirit in the first place? In the gospels and authentic letters discernment is not encouraged only for \"special\" people, in fact the people, including the \"perfect\" disciples, are repeatedly rebuked for not doing so as if it should go without saying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes this is somewhat true. This was covered above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The gospels and Paul's actual letters are both extremely clear that it is NOT works. They encourage good works and seem to expect that believers will desire to do so, but are adamant that faith alone is what does it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You obviously missed what I said about the undue tension between faith and works and what James is actually about. Faith alone cannot save, and neither can works. The two words “faith” and “alone” are not used in that context in the Bible except to say that we are not justified by faith alone (James 2:25). Let me give you a hypothetical example: I could be the most vocal person on the face of the Earth about my faith in Jesus and how I am saved, yet I could also be the most self-centered and sedentary man on Earth, doing absolutely nothing to act upon my faith, yet I still claim to have faith. This is the purpose of the epistle of James (which is thought to be earliest book written in the Old Testament and has never been considered pseudepigraphical by any mainstream early, early-modern, or contemporary Christian theologian), to exhort is to accompany our faith with works, that is why James says “not by faith <em>only</em>”. For if I regarded my faith in that way, then I would be perfectly described by James 2:19. Many areas in Paul’s epistles also state that we are “created in Christ Jesus for good works (Ephesians 2:10),” that “faith working through love” is sufficient (Galatians 5:6), and that we are to “work out [our] own salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12).” Now of course, works do not save us, as that would render faith and the work of Christ worthless. For our own righteousness, as Isaiah 64:6 says, “are as filthy rags.” Within the two verses before Eph. 2:10, Paul writes that we are saved by faith, which is a gift of God, and of course you know that Galatians 1-5 concerns this subject, that works do not save us. But you notice that these passages about faith are often accompanied with a statement about works and vice versa, to the extent that it may appear to be a contradiction to some. But again, as I said the first time, this arises from the false dialectic which arises between faith and works within western Christian soteriology; I will say again that in order for one to have true faith, it must produce works, otherwise it is dead. In order for one to produce true works, they must be done out of faith in God, otherwise they are worthless.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The parable of the pharisee and the tax collector makes no sense otherwise, nor do many stories in the gospels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a good opportunity to ask a question. I know that the pharisee’s pride was born out of a reliance that his works made him righteous before God, and therefore he was the more damnable. However, can’t the publican’s repentance be con</p>\n","created_utc":1612143220,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_phee","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"phee","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":6,"parent_comment_id":["pdgs"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/7688/the-entire-bible-is-context/phee","post_id":"7688","score":3,"upvotes":3,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["phee"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/7688/the-entire-bible-is-context/pjmk","post":{"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"Taking bible verses out of context has become something many Christians have learned to avoid, so they believe that taking the verse in the context of the story is valid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an incorrect assumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the Bible does not contradict itself, not a single verse will contradict the Bible.

If a verse's only bounds are its story, and the conclusion/meaning of the story that is jumped to contradicts the Bible, it is not the true meaning of the story (Not that the decided meaning is immediately completely invalid, but it has parts that were assumed incorrectly, and need to be fixed).

For example, if I were to say \"No, hell doesn't exist because God is loving\" and you say the reason Hell exists when God is loving (though I'm not going to go into it right now), and I say \"Well, there's more verses that say God is loving, so I guess that's wrong\" I would be completely incorrect.

If a verse's only bounds are its story, and the conclusion/meaning of the story that is jumped to contradicts the Bible, it is not the true meaning of the story (Not that the decided meaning is immediately completely invalid, but it has parts that were assumed incorrectly, and need to be fixed).

It actually means *assembly* which is the ministry as a whole, and it's also quite possibly an interpolation added by catholics to support the papacy.

Why would the Holy Spirit need to indwell in believers if they're just supposed to listen to the church?\r\n\r\n> Therefore, when we have the testimony of the early Christians, such as St. Ignatius, St. Clement, and St. Polycarp, who themselves were students of Apostles and Disciples of Christ such as St. John and St, Peter, we can safely conclude that what they say is correct based upon the Words of Christ Himself. Furthermore, it is these very individuals who testify of and appeal authoritatively to the books which you cite as “forgeries”.\r\n\r\nI'm skeptical of all these early church saints because they often contradict Jesus and some of them seem like they had an agenda or were agents of the Roman empire. Not even the disciples who had physically been with Jesus for 3 years could agree on major issues, let alone them. Also calling people \"saint\" is pretty much idolatry and judging in place of God. I'm not aware of anyone in the bible ever addressing people with that title, not even in later forgeries like the pastoral epistles.\r\n\r\n> That is precisely how we know the whole of the New Testament to be scripture and how we know who wrote them: not by using the books to prove themselves, but learning from those led by the Holy Spirit, upholding their veracity for our sakes as their spiritual descendants.\r\n\r\nDon't you need your own discernment to determine who was led by the Holy Spirit in the first place? In the gospels and authentic letters discernment is not encouraged only for \"special\" people, in fact the people, including the \"perfect\" disciples, are repeatedly rebuked for *not* doing so as if it should go without saying.\r\n\r\n> As for the books you claim teach “works salvation,” this simply results from a misunderstanding which arises from a false dichotomy between faith and works, which are in fact inseparable. James 2:18 even says something to this effect when he writes, “But someone will say, ‘You have faith, and I have works.’ Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” Revelation 20:12 also speaks of the role which works have in our salvation when the Apostle John (the same John who wrote John 1:1) describes people being judged by their works before God during the Last Judgement.\r\n\r\nThe gospels and Paul's actual letters are both extremely clear that it is NOT works. They encourage good works and seem to expect that believers will *desire* to do so, but are adamant that faith alone is what does it. The parable of the pharisee and the tax collector makes no sense otherwise, nor do many stories in the gospels. Also James 2:14 is clear that works *save* a person, so saying it's talking about evidence and good fruit is just twisting it. It even quotes against Paul's use of Abraham's faith being counted as righteousness, with an odd interpretation of Abraham being saved by his about-to-sacrifice Isaac. The epistle of \"James\" is also pseudographical. Also the John who wrote Revelation was likely NOT the same John as the one who wrote the gospel of John and maybe the 3 letters of John, there is some complaints from early churches that a false teacher had forged it and that John had denounced him, and the wildly different writing styles would seem to agree. Not saying this is what happened but it's a possibility, there's some seemingly contradictory messages in Revelation but it's also extremely difficult to interpret, I give it a 50/50 chance of being authentic. As for Revelation 20:12, it also speaks of the book of life of people who were exempt from this judgement, which would agree with the rest of the NT that judgement and law is for non-believers, not believers (and by believers I mean actual followers).\r\n\r\n> As for John 1 itself, I honestly don’t see where this dilemma arises that the Bible cannot be the Word of God because Jesus is the Word of God. They are both correctly referred to as the Word of God. Jesus is the Word, the divine Logos, because He proclaims the Gospel of Salvation which comes from the Father through Him: He is the Gospel. The Bible is the Word of God because it is the full, wholly true, and wholly inspired revelation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Who is fully God and fully man, unto mankind by the Holy Spirit and God the Father as far as human language is able to properly describe it.\r\n\r\nThis is completely false. It gives no indication of a perfect, preserved text. None.

Obviously that point will always be stationary with everything else moving in comparison to it. If that's the sun, then earth revolves around the sun and rotates, as does everything. However if it's earth, then the sun revolves around earth, as does everything. One isn't any more correct than the other, technically they're both true depending on what your point of reference is. The main star is simply the most logical choice because it's central to nearly all solar systems, and it's the simplest model with which to explain gravity and different forces that the star plays a major role in for all objects in the solar system. This is why we don't feel the earth spinning or moving through space, because our point of reference is ourselves, who are on earth, and therefore from our perspective the earth is geocentric. But if we were on the sun, it would be solarcentric. When you get on a merry-go-round, it doesn't move at all, the world around it does and you can only tell it's the merry-go-round that's moving because of wind and air resistance. But when you're in the outside world the merry-go-round moves and the world stays the same. There's no grand central point of space we're comparing anything to absolutely, it all depends on perspective, and we've chosen the sun because it's the best one to use for science.","body_html":"<p>And earth also still does revolve around the sun and spins and moves at the same time.
