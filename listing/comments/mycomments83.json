Our sole purpose is as the provider and defender, and also sperm providers. We are basically incapable of feeling any emotion strongly except for anger and aggression, and this is our default. We have half the brain women do and are less smart as a result, not to mention almost zero creative ability; there are way more male \"geniuses\" but only because men are pressured to succeed while the women are allowed to be lazy because men have to do everything for them. The top IQ on record is from a woman, and brain scans have shown their cognitive abilities to be superior even though they are nowhere near as cultivated. And despite our role as the physical laborer and fighter, our pain tolerance is actually lower, because nature doesn't give a shit about us, only what we do for society. We are to toil in hard labor and risky, painful situations while everyone else reaps the benefits of it. And fail or even express the slightest discontentment about it, and society punishes you. As a man, your life is literally *supposed* to be miserable, both socially and biologically. Men are biologically stripped of any ability to feel content or happy. We are pawns and slaves, and no one cares about us. We die younger, suck at everything but athletics, are miserable all the time, and basically are slaves. Your life is destined to be miserable and you have to like it. Men have basically nothing good going for themselves. Nature gave men the rough end of the deal, with the exception of a few thousand years where they got jealous and oppressed the women, and that didn't help men, it just made women miserable too. At least we're not honey bees. No wonder \"women have more depression\" even though far more men kill themselves. Because everyone feels bad and sees it as a problem if a girl is depressed, but boys are *supposed* to feel that way and be miserable and just accept it.\r\n\r\nFuck off feminazis. You haven't the first clue about what male \"privilege\" is. None. Our lives are slavery, and even now that we have the opportunity for more for the first time, we still are biologically designed to be worthless slaves and rarely capable of anything else. You don't realize how much we have to pay just to be able to lap you on a track and be obligated to awful duties no one wants to do. It's not a fair trade, and guess what? You didn't get the rough end of deal, men did.","body_html":"<p>Also I'm adding #34: Biologically men are not designed to have content, happy, or enjoyable lives. Our sole purpose is as the provider and defender, and also sperm providers. We are basically incapable of feeling any emotion strongly except for anger and aggression, and this is our default. We have half the brain women do and are less smart as a result, not to mention almost zero creative ability; there are way more male \"geniuses\" but only because men are pressured to succeed while the women are allowed to be lazy because men have to do everything for them. The top IQ on record is from a woman, and brain scans have shown their cognitive abilities to be superior even though they are nowhere near as cultivated. And despite our role as the physical laborer and fighter, our pain tolerance is actually lower, because nature doesn't give a shit about us, only what we do for society. We are to toil in hard labor and risky, painful situations while everyone else reaps the benefits of it. And fail or even express the slightest discontentment about it, and society punishes you. As a man, your life is literally <em>supposed</em> to be miserable, both socially and biologically. Men are biologically stripped of any ability to feel content or happy. We are pawns and slaves, and no one cares about us. We die younger, suck at everything but athletics, are miserable all the time, and basically are slaves. Your life is destined to be miserable and you have to like it. Men have basically nothing good going for themselves. Nature gave men the rough end of the deal, with the exception of a few thousand years where they got jealous and oppressed the women, and that didn't help men, it just made women miserable too. At least we're not honey bees. No wonder \"women have more depression\" even though far more men kill themselves. Because everyone feels bad and sees it as a problem if a girl is depressed, but boys are <em>supposed</em> to feel that way and be miserable and just accept it.</p>\n<p>Fuck off feminazis. You haven't the first clue about what male \"privilege\" is. None. Our lives are slavery, and even now that we have the opportunity for more for the first time, we still are biologically designed to be worthless slaves and rarely capable of anything else. You don't realize how much we have to pay just to be able to lap you on a track and be obligated to awful duties no one wants to do. It's not a fair trade, and guess what?
