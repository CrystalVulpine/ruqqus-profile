But, flying is expensive as fuck. Research is often free. I dabbled in a bit just for fun, and once I discovered I had a knack for it, it became more interesting. I was once in a training class for work and was classified as \"independent thinker\" in which I didn't give a shit what the mainstream says, I arrived at my own conclusions based on my own research. They said that's actually rare, but \"many of life's greatest leaders belonged to this group\".</p>\n<p>Lineage doesn't mean shit when you beat your own path. My ancestors were drivers, loggers, general maintenance, etc. But, that was then and this is now, the circumstances change. You seem like you're trying to be something you're not. I was a musician once, in a band that kinda sucked. But, I didn't give a shit because it was fun. I didn't get discouraged just because others did better. I embraced competition, it helped shape and build my own style.</p>\n<p>You have skills you aren't even aware of yet.</p>\n","created_utc":1611698490,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_owvk","guild_id":"1xf","herald_guild":null,"id":"owvk","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":13,"parent_comment_id":["ovci"],"permalink":"/+TheoryOfRuqqus/post/6y3l/delete-my-main-account-xigbar68-httpsmeganzfmlrxguaja/owvk","post_id":"6y3l","score":2,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["owvk"],"permalink":"/+TheoryOfRuqqus/post/6y3l/delete-my-main-account-xigbar68-httpsmeganzfmlrxguaja/oxuw","post":{"ban_reason":"","guild_name":"TheoryOfRuqqus","id":"6y3l","is_banned":true,"is_deleted":false,"is_pinned":false,"permalink":"/+TheoryOfRuqqus/post/6y3l/delete-my-main-account-xigbar68-httpsmeganzfmlrxguaja","title":"DELETE MY MAIN ACCOUNT @XIGBAR68, https://mega.nz/fm/LRxgUaja"},"post_id":"6y3l","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
