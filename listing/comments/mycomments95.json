For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.\r\n> \r\n> 2 Peter 2:20-22\r\n\r\n2 Peter is a forgery that teaches false doctrines. While it is true that the one who has knowledge of the truth and rejects it is worse off than before (blasphemy of the Holy Spirit) it is only through deliberate rejection and contempt that this is the case, not by slipping up as you seem to think.\r\n\r\n> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\r\n> \r\n> Matthew 7:21\r\n\r\nYes, by having a change of heart which also means you will naturally follow the commandments. Not your legalistic nonsense. In fact, if you are only obeying to \"get into heaven\" and not out of heart, you are not obeying them at all!\r\n\r\n> Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\r\n> \r\n> Luke 13:23-24\r\n\r\nYes, the ones pleading their WORKS as the reason to enter.\r\n\r\n> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\r\n> \r\n> James 2:19-20\r\n\r\nJames is a forgery and it's clearly written by Jews who wanted to revert Christianity back to their system of works salvation. Jesus is barely even mentioned in the whole right-strawy epistle.\r\n\r\nLook, I can play this game too!\r\n\r\n> To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. **He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.** For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”\r\n\r\n> **All things are lawful to me**, but not all things do benefit. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be mastered by anything.\r\n\r\n> When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” The centurion replied, “**Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof**. But just say the word, and my servant\\* will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “**Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.** But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.\r\n\r\n\\* very likely the centurion's *catamite* (ΠΑΙΣ). If that is indeed the case then the point of this story is made even stronger, as we can no longer twist \"I do not deserve to have you come under my roof\" into merely a humble statement.\r\n\r\n> Many will say to me on that day, ‘**Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?**’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you.

If you are a married woman, AND YOUR ORIGINAL HUSBAND DIES, then, and only then, may you remarry, HOWEVER, your new husband MUST 100% be a born again Christian that abides in The Lord Jesus Christ -- if any of these conditions are not met, you will earn onto yourselves, eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire, for BOTH PARTIES INVOLVED.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it should be noted, that a man that has never been married, CANNOT marry a divorced woman, and likewise, a woman that has never been married, CANNOT marry a divorced man - if any of these forbidden combinations occur, BOTH parties involved, will earn onto themselves, eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire.\r\n\r\nIf you are in an illegitimate and unholy marriage, you MUST REPENT AND REMEDY IT IMMEDIATELY - you must immediately divorce your illegitimate abomination of a \"spouse\", and remain single and celibate for the rest of your life, or in the case of a woman, UNTIL YOUR ORIGINAL HUSBAND DIES  -- IF YOU DO NOT DO THESE THINGS, YOU WILL *B-O-T-H* RECEIVE ONTO YOURSELVES, ETERNAL DAMNATION IN THE LAKE OF FIRE...\r\n\r\nAdultery is a sin, and anyone that remarries outside of the rules ordained by The Lord Jesus Christ, COMMITS ADULTERY, which is an INTENTIONAL SIN - YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY SINNING ALL OF THE TIME, 24/7, AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN IN AN ILLEGITIMATE MARRIAGE -- if the rapture happens, you will be left behind, and if you die, you will go straight to Hell.\r\n\r\nThere is a piece of scripture in Matthew 5:32, which is parallel to Luke 16:18, but with the addition of \"...saving for the cause of fornication...\", which SEEMS to say (my own interpretation) that an exception can be made for cases where the husband, after getting married, finds out that his wife wasn't a virgin, but I believe that this is an extremely rare case -- if a man finds himself in this situation, I'd recommend that he pray about it heavily, and then do what God's Holy Spirit has told him to do.  I feel that Matthew 5:32 is a confusing piece of scripture, and some people would argue that it refers to an exception being made for an unfaithful wife, but I disagree with them; if you look at the scripture, the word used is \"fornication\", which is similar to \"adultery\", except \"fornication\" happens before people are married, which leads me to believe that the scripture is referring to an exception being made for a wife that lied about being a virgin.  Thus being said, it is my opinion that it would be far safer to NOT remarry in the above scenario, but the choice is up to you; why risk damnation?\r\n\r\nLastly, it should be noted, that CELIBATE means CELIBATE - fornication with one's self is an INTENTIONAL SIN, as well as an abomination; the born again Christian should not forget that The Holy Spirit of God lives inside them -- anyone that defiles God's temple will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 3:16-17\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFlee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 6:18-20\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWhosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.\r\n\r\nLuke 16:18\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\r\n\r\nMatthew 5:32\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 7:8-9\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 7:39\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.\r\n\r\nShe also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.\r\n\r\nProverbs 23:27-28\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\r\n\r\nMatthew 5:27-28\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMarriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.\r\n\r\nHebrews 13:4\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAnd why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\r\n\r\nLuke 6:46\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAnd being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;\r\n\r\nHebrews 5:9\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. \r\n\r\nMatthew 7:21\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThem that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.\r\n\r\n1 Timothy 5:20\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBehold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.\r\n\r\nEzekiel 18:4\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nStop sinning, or go to the Lake of Fire...\r\n\r\n----------","body_html":"<hr/>\n<p>Remarriage is an absolute sin, except for one exception - a female WIDOW, that has never been divorced, may remarry a born again man that has never been married; ALL other possible combinations are a sin, which will result in eternal damnation for BOTH involved parties.</p>\n<p>The Lord Jesus Christ says that marriage is for life, except in the case of the female widow; if you're a man, and your wife has died, or if you have been divorced, you MUST remain unmarried and celibate for the rest of your life, or you will die in your (INTENTIONAL) sins, and BOTH you, AND your illegitimate abomination of a wife, will receive onto yourselves, eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire.</p>\n<p>If you're a divorced woman, you must remain single and celibate for the rest of your life.  If you are a married woman, AND YOUR ORIGINAL HUSBAND DIES, then, and only then, may you remarry, HOWEVER, your new husband MUST 100% be a born again Christian that abides in The Lord Jesus Christ -- if any of these conditions are not met, you will earn onto yourselves, eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire, for BOTH PARTIES INVOLVED.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it should be noted, that a man that has never been married, CANNOT marry a divorced woman, and likewise, a woman that has never been married, CANNOT marry a divorced man - if any of these forbidden combinations occur, BOTH parties involved, will earn onto themselves, eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire.</p>\n<p>If you are in an illegitimate and unholy marriage, you MUST REPENT AND REMEDY IT IMMEDIATELY - you must immediately divorce your illegitimate abomination of a \"spouse\", and remain single and celibate for the rest of your life, or in the case of a woman, UNTIL YOUR ORIGINAL HUSBAND DIES  -- IF YOU DO NOT DO THESE THINGS, YOU WILL <em>B-O-T-H</em> RECEIVE ONTO YOURSELVES, ETERNAL DAMNATION IN THE LAKE OF FIRE...</p>\n<p>Adultery is a sin, and anyone that remarries outside of the rules ordained by The Lord Jesus Christ, COMMITS ADULTERY, which is an INTENTIONAL SIN - YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY SINNING ALL OF THE TIME, 24/7, AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN IN AN ILLEGITIMATE MARRIAGE -- if the rapture happens, you will be left behind, and if you die, you will go straight to Hell.</p>\n<p>There is a piece of scripture in Matthew 5:32, which is parallel to Luke 16:18, but with the addition of \"...saving for the cause of fornication...\", which SEEMS to say (my own interpretation) that an exception can be made for cases where the husband, after getting married, finds out that his wife wasn't a virgin, but I believe that this is an extremely rare case -- if a man finds himself in this situation, I'd recommend that he pray about it heavily, and then do what God's Holy Spirit has told him to do.  I feel that Matthew 5:32 is a confusing piece of scripture, and some people would argue that it refers to an exception being made for an unfaithful wife, but I disagree with them; if you look at the scripture, the word used is \"fornication\", which is similar to \"adultery\", except \"fornication\" happens before people are married, which leads me to believe that the scripture is referring to an exception being made for a wife that lied about being a virgin.  Thus being said, it is my opinion that it would be far safer to NOT remarry in the above scenario, but the choice is up to you; why risk damnation?</p>\n<p>Lastly, it should be noted, that CELIBATE means CELIBATE - fornication with one's self is an INTENTIONAL SIN, as well as an abomination; the born again Christian should not forget that The Holy Spirit of God lives inside them -- anyone that defiles God's temple will be destroyed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>\n<p>1 Corinthians 3:16-17</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
