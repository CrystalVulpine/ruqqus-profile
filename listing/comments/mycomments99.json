If he was really about enriching big business he would have done different things. Trump was known as a compassionate and generous man before he was president. \r\n\r\nIn 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill’s family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill’s pleas for help in news reports.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn’t hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: “We’ve paid off your mortgage.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach, Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump “put the light on Palm Beach – not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination.” Foxman also noted that Trump’s charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl’s story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, after Jennifer Hudson’s family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump’s security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn’t even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine’s release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tearfully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she’s the “bravest woman, I know.” She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.\r\n\r\nLynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he’s a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she’s struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through “immensely difficult times.”\r\n\r\nhttps://townhall.com/columnists/lizcrokin/2016/07/10/trump-does-the-unthinkable-n2190160\r\n\r\nAlso everyone forgets that Trump donates his presidential salary:\r\n\r\n2017 first quarter: donated to The Department of the Interior for The National Park Service, for the preservation, security and maintenance projects of the nation’s 25 battlefields.\r\n\r\n2017 2nd quarter: The Department of Education, which would fund science, engineering, technology, and math STEM focused camp for students.\r\n\r\n2017 3rd quarter: Health and Human Services to help combat the opioid epidemic.\r\n\r\n2017 4th quarter: Department of Transportation – Supporting and modernizing crumbling and falling infrastructures.\r\n\r\n2018 1st quarter: The Department of Veteran’s Affairs to support its Caregiver Programs.\r\n\r\n2018 2nd quarter: The Small Business Administrations, in support of Veteran program called “Emerging Leaders” which is an adaptation program for transitioning Veterans who are in process of leaving the military world and entering the civilian world and job markets, this program makes job and career endeavors hopeful with training and possible Entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n2018 3rd quarter: The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism, researching the disease of alcoholism.

For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.\"</p>\n<p>May all personally encounter the presence and attention of the Lord God.</p>\n<p>Curiosity, questions, discussion, and prayer requests are welcome.</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_41","id":"41","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Christianity","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Christianity","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/profile-1.png"},"guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"mc28","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"Hell is for those who understand Christ and reject His character and works of divinity or confound Him as something evil.\n\nMy understanding is there are 6 actions that will keep you from the Kingdom of God.\n\n1.
