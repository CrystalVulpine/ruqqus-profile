A few of them are older trolls who went silent until recently because of the seethe from the echo-chamber while others are newer ones. These people have two ways of trolling, either going against the echo-chamber (which most do), or LARPing so far right it even makes those in the echo-chamber surprised. This is evidenced by the timing that these people started trolling, around election days and after that (the same time <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a> was created). For them to join they have to be at least 1 month old users for them to know about the \"takeover\" and start trolling. This rules out the possibility that AHS or redditors were behind this. These trolls are likely alts for old users who use them to troll. Also <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a> was coordinated by a few of us on discord to generate seethe as we were tired of the echo-chamber and wasn't because of shills or even Deux, with the only connection being Carp. Nobody on <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a> is a shill. Same goes for <a href=\"/+DeuxRAMA\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+DeuxRAMA/pic/profile\"/>+DeuxRAMA</a>. It seems like the rightoid seriousposters either don't know or have forgotten the original purpose of that subreddit/guild, which is to indulge in drama and make it as fun as possible by not taking it seriously.</p>\n<p>If you're now wondering about the screenshots on <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, the discord server and the Sion ordeal, those were faked by us as well, all by a few of us on discord writing ridiculous statements. The fact that anyone even took it seriously shows how deep they are into the echo-chamber and unable to detect any satire or irony. This was started by people with relatively higher rep and since this was on discord, we eventually were able to get more people with high rep and influence on board. We even got kek to join on the last day. If you spent a fair amount of time on ruqqus discord (or even ruqqus), you'd recognize these names as being older users who contributed a lot to the site. The fact that no one even bothered going through the profiles makes me question if you even bothered doing any research before declaring everyone shills, most of whom had public profiles until recently. Many of these are the very people who were behind creating the good parts about the site, before voatcels took over. Also, there have been no examples of this so called \"subversion\" of this site except Klens guilds (on his alt accounts) being taken after he got temporarily banned. If you think more people shitting on far righters after the trolling started is evidence for shills it isn't because of shills, but because you've exposed your stupidity and are getting shit on for it. People disagreeing with you more now isn't \"subversion\". If you don't know this already, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a> is an alt for <a href=\"/@Emerald41\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Emerald41/pic/profile\"/>@Emerald41</a>, not some \"whistleblower\". Evidence: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a/jwmg\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/qA3qWdb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+DumpsterFire/post/5r3w/when-you-get-your-feelings-hurt/jwr1\">3</a>. Everyone in this guild fell for the bait, even though we even made it so easy to recognize. This easily destroys any form of credibility this guild has. It has done nothing valuable except expose the retardation of average ruqqusers.</p>\n<p>I don't expect you to take this seriously given how retarded you have to be to get here in the first place, but let this be a moment for self reflection that you're in the echo-chamber so deep that you've forgotten that people who disagree normally, people who troll, and people in the center even fucking exist and its all an us vs them mentality. The average ruqquser doesn't care about free speech anymore and are willing to censor those who disagree by means such as labelling them as shills in hopes for the admins to get them banned. I've lost hope in this site. I'll likely give up on ruqqus soon since the echo-chamber will only get worse until the update and even the update might not be enough to salvage this site. The echo-chamber is actively what is will kill this site.</p>\n", "comment_count": 49, "created_utc": 1608074286, "domain": "i.ruqqus.com", "downvotes": 16, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_5s60", "guild_id": "4vm", "guild_name": "ShillWall", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5s60", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills", "score": 12, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/5s60/thumb.png", "title": "The difference between \"trolls\" and \"shills\"", "upvotes": 28, "url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5s60/hMxZjtRFDas"}, "post_id": "5s60", "score": 4, "upvotes": 7, "voted": 0}
