There's no \"unfiltered all\", there's no default \"other\" category for uncategorized guilds (which means you can't opt in to seeing them), and there's no way for regular users to categorize such guilds (kek said that you, the admins, can try to categorize them, but won't that take a long time with the amount of guilds there are on ruqqus?). In fact, there's no way to tell if a guild is uncategorized until you try to post in it. There's also no indication on /all that uncategorized guilds are hidden.

But later, you'll still address the issues with these new features, right? I like the idea of the category system, but the current implementation just doesn't work. The main problem I'm talking about is that guilds have to be categorized in order to show up in /all. Right now, if a guild has an inactive mod, the guild is basically quarantined. There's no \"unfiltered all\", there's no default \"other\" category for uncategorized guilds (which means you can't opt in to seeing them), and there's no way for regular users to categorize such guilds (kek said that you, the admins, can try to categorize them, but won't that take a long time with the amount of guilds there are on ruqqus?). In fact, there's no way to tell if a guild is uncategorized until you try to post in it. There's also no indication on /all that uncategorized guilds are hidden. I hope you'll address this issue soon.
