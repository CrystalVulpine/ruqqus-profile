Put a \"Skip and show all\" button right next to the \"Welcome to Ruqqus\" / \"Select Categories\" text for convenience.

Can this only apply to the \"home\" page and not the \"all\" page for logged out users?

Otherwise, the visibility of uncategorized guilds is still going to be hindered.</li>\n<li>Put a \"Skip and show all\" button right next to the \"Welcome to Ruqqus\" / \"Select Categories\" text for convenience. I know there's already a \"show all\" button at the bottom of the page, but I dislike it when there's no easy-to-find skip button on these types of pages.</li>\n<li>Can this only apply to the \"home\" page and not the \"all\" page for logged out users? I'm obsessed with archiving the front page of ruqqus on sites like <a href=\"https://archive.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">archive.org</a> and <a href=\"https://archive.is\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">archive.is</a>, and I'm not sure if it can still be done. (If the user hasn't chosen any categories yet, then display all categories on the /all page.)</li>\n<li>It looks like when you first sign up, you get redirected to the /browse page. I think that it was mentioned that you didn't want new users seeing the site prompt them to join guilds like <a href=\"/+HitlerWasRight\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+HitlerWasRight/pic/profile\"/>+HitlerWasRight</a> (which conveniently happens to be trending).
