So instead I\u2019m gonna go a different route and explain one way to tell a community\u2019s fate.\r\n\r\nThat is the number of moderators they have and how many have been suspended. Smaller subs are generally more vulnerable to being banned if they hit zero.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at r/FellowRetrievers. This sub landed in the very high category because I had seen AHS complain about it a lot.\r\n\r\nThen I second guessed myself, until I looked in the moderator tab there yesterday after learning the reason why AHS hated them so much, and I saw that only one out of nine moderators wasn\u2019t suspended there. However, just before I made this I checked back and it appears the last mod, u/AttachableShells, has been suspended as well. This now means that the sub is restricted and considering it\u2019s history don\u2019t be surprised if it gets banned for being unmoderated soon. This could be the same tactic at work used in r/RedditHasCancer or r/YallCantBehave.\r\n\r\nI decided to look in all of the other high and above risk subs that aren\u2019t already banned or private,

Smaller subs are generally more vulnerable to being banned if they hit zero.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at r/FellowRetrievers. This sub landed in the very high category because I had seen AHS complain about it a lot.</p>\n<p>Then I second guessed myself, until I looked in the moderator tab there yesterday after learning the reason why AHS hated them so much, and I saw that only one out of nine moderators wasn\u2019t suspended there. However, just before I made this I checked back and it appears the last mod, u/AttachableShells, has been suspended as well. This now means that the sub is restricted and considering it\u2019s history don\u2019t be surprised if it gets banned for being unmoderated soon.

When I first made the subreddit everyone mocked my \"crazy\" conspiracy theories. Now it's practically undeniable that the DefaultMods cabal exists. Turns out I wasn't as crazy as people made me out to be when they were immediately dismissing me before even reading what I was writing.\r\n\r\nAnd before you stop reading, no, I don't think the admins are a bunch of secret agents colluding with the mods to take over the world or some shit. Nothing evil is actually happening right now aside from possibly a bit of rudeness towards non-mods from the admins. This is primarily a concern for what the future will hold if the flaws in the admins' current moderation system are not fixed.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Ruqqus has recently entered the beginning stages of this phenomenon previously demonstrated by reddit and digg. Currently we are the point where it is made up of like-minded people who can be trusted and support Ruqqus's goals. Most people don't see any problem yet. I only do because this is similar to how reddit's cabal got started, innocent enough at first that most people don't think about it until it's too late. It will probably remain in this state for several years. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have caught on either, as I wasn't looking for it myself, but I happen to know two people in this group on Ruqqus, so they're more recognizable to me, and seeing them listed everywhere that involves the admins got my attention.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was two users becoming guildmasters of +WatchRedditDie, which the admins run. I know of at least 2 other /r/WatchRedditDie mods here not including myself that were not invited. However, since Ruqqus lacks a PM feature, Ruqqus relies on Discord for this (terrible idea imo) and only those two have Discord accounts. So this was most likely just a coincidence and unrelated to the recent developments, although the admin interactions with them could have been setting the stage.\r\n\r\nAfter /u/spez started the giant banwave and the Discord server got flooded is when things got more interesting. Prior to this, the only people with authority on the server were the admins. However, they needed to add more mods now because they couldn't keep up with the influx. Contrary to popular belief, this *was* confirmed to be based on users' suggestions, not just the admins picking people they knew, although I don't doubt that it influenced their decisions. Unfortunately that was the last time the admins were willing to discuss anything regarding moderation or management with the Ruqqus userbase.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the admins made a private channel between them and the mods, and also started talking to them directly in DMs. This was a very bad decision imo. Keep in mind that the Discord server is *official*, and the admins are being untransparent here about what they and these mods are doing.\r\n\r\nAs the admins got to know these mods more, they of course became more withdrawn from the rest of the site. They now *refuse* to discuss anything about moderation or management of Ruqqus or the Discord server with anyone except the Discord mods. Even worse, it is currently *impossible* to become one of those mods if you're not one already. The mods suggested that this be changed too, but the admins just say something about a future plan and ignore them. Now, if anyone except these mods makes suggestions to the admins about how they manage either Ruqqus or the server, they tell you something along the lines of \"you don't have the right to give us your input\". The only people they are willing to discuss these things with now are the Discord mods, usually in their private channel. And it's bleeding out into the main site too, as these mods are also being made guildmasters of the official admin-run guilds. In fact some of the guilds were created from the mods' ideas, and I highly doubt the admins would give anyone else that sort of attention.\r\n\r\nThis lines up with the recent questionable activity, such as users being banned for reasons that aren't stated in the content policy, and the admins saying \"we don't care what you think\" when inquired about it. This is nothing like their prior attitude.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that these mod groups together with the admins becomes cliques, and in the future they always end up ruining things. I'm sure we have a few years yet, but as soon as the current good members leave and get replaced by less trustworthy mods, the censorship will start. To anyone who remembers this from reddit or even digg, please pay attention, because we're seeing it again. Do we want this to happen a third time now? I know for a fact the admins don't want a cabal, but they don't realize that they already started one. Unfortunately, they now brush off all concerns about it. This is the one thing they won't even talk to the mods about.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**How this can be fixed:**\r\n\r\n1. Stop relying on fucking *Discord* for everything. In a way, Discord caused all of this. The admins needed new mods frantically to enforce Discord's insane TOS, which caused a chain recation that already has effects on the main site now. Ruqqus needs its own chat function, and a PM feature. I don't think using a platform literally run by reddit DefaultMods jannies such as allthefoxes, the guy who had /u/spez take over /r/yiffinhell for him, is in Ruqqus's interests. I don't have anything against the admins for choosing it, as it is the most popular choice and appeals to the most people, but I think it needs corrected. Admins should remove the links to the discord server from Ruqqus's pages, give ownership of it to the mods, and stop associating with it, instead focusing on something different.\r\n\r\n2. Don't have non-admins managing parts of the site (meaning the official stuff, not non-admin guilds) until there's a way to actually get those positions. Right now you *can't* become a mod unless you were already chosen to be one, which can be greatly abused.\r\n\r\n3. Make the moderation/feature discussions with the admins open and transparent. Don't limit this ability to only the mods. Don't be having private \"mod chats\" where the mods get more insider information, privileges, and say than what's supposed to be avaiable to end users. Don't only listen to the mods. This is all especially true considering point #2. If this is not done it opens to door for an admin-mod clique to form (already true now), and then eventually a cabal. Unlike the admins seem to think, just because someone isn't one of their mods shouldn't mean their suggestions don't matter and shouldn't be heard.\r\n\r\n4. Don't make non-admins guildmasters or managers of official parts of the site. If help is actually needed, have a way for users to become mods, not just DMing specific people and asking if they can do it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe admins probably won't care about this post since I'm not a mod. Unfortunately, the only way this will change is if we get their attention. Please make this known throughtout Ruqqus whenever you can and encourage people to speak up about it. If you support this site right now, it is your *duty* to do so to keep Ruqqus what it is. Your efforts are highly worth it and greatly appreciated, because unlike reddit, Ruqqus can still be fixed. It's not *that* broken yet, but the cracks will get bigger and bigger until they're repaired. Remember, the more people that know about this, the better chance we have at fixing it.\r\n\r\nIf any of the mods are reading this, do the same thing. But you play a special role here. Bring this up in the mod channels and admin guilds from time to time. Let the admins know you will not stand for a powermod cabal. And post the admins' responses about it so we can know where we're at. Other than that, be extra careful with your power, and thank you for all the time you've taken to help Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the admins have now kicked this post from +Ruqqus to +general. Should probably show you how they feel about this.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2: the admins have now yanked this post back to +Ruqqus. Take that as you will, but I'm going to assume the kick to +general was a mistake.", "body_html": "<p>As the creator of /r/The_Cabal I know quite a bit about these powermod cabal power structures and how they work. When I first made the subreddit everyone mocked my \"crazy\" conspiracy theories. Now it's practically undeniable that the DefaultMods cabal exists. Turns out I wasn't as crazy as people made me out to be when they were immediately dismissing me before even reading what I was writing.</p>\n<p>And before you stop reading, no, I don't think the admins are a bunch of secret agents colluding with the mods to take over the world or some shit. Nothing evil is actually happening right now aside from possibly a bit of rudeness towards non-mods from the admins. This is primarily a concern for what the future will hold if the flaws in the admins' current moderation system are not fixed.</p>\n<p>Long story short, Ruqqus has recently entered the beginning stages of this phenomenon previously demonstrated by reddit and digg. Currently we are the point where it is made up of like-minded people who can be trusted and support Ruqqus's goals. Most people don't see any problem yet. I only do because this is similar to how reddit's cabal got started, innocent enough at first that most people don't think about it until it's too late. It will probably remain in this state for several years. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have caught on either, as I wasn't looking for it myself, but I happen to know two people in this group on Ruqqus, so they're more recognizable to me, and seeing them listed everywhere that involves the admins got my attention.</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed was two users becoming guildmasters of <a href=\"/+WatchRedditDie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+WatchRedditDie/pic/profile\"/>+WatchRedditDie</a>, which the admins run. I know of at least 2 other /r/WatchRedditDie mods here not including myself that were not invited. However, since Ruqqus lacks a PM feature, Ruqqus relies on Discord for this (terrible idea imo) and only those two have Discord accounts.
