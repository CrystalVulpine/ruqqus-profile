Can I ask you a few questions?\r\n\r\n1. Can you receive orangereds? Do username mentions work for you? (I've mentioned you already.) If you mention someone else, do they receive an orangered?\r\n2. Can you accept mod invites? (I'm guessing yes, since testalt008 was able to do it)\r\n3. After you get modded, you can perform mod actions, right? (Like uploading images for the stylesheet, editing the subreddit settings, etc.) (I remember that testalt008 was able to mod WRD)\r\n4. All subreddits you create are insta-banned, correct? Can you try making /r/Banned_Subreddit with this in the description: \"Made by a shadowbanned user\"?\r\n5. Can you send PMs/modmail (as a regular user and as a mod)/chat messages? (I would think that you can't, since shadowbanning is usually done to prevent spam.) Can you try sending messages to my account cqtz and my subreddits /r/srname and /r/u_cqtz? Can you choose a subreddit of mine to be a mod of (I don't mod anything grandiose; just pick the one you like the best, I guess) and try sending modmail from it?\r\n6. You can be added as an approved user to a subreddit, right? Would that do anything in regards to your posts getting filtered or not? (Can you choose one of my subs to be an approved user of? Can you post/comment in that subreddit as well as another subreddit that I mod (note that /r/srname has AutoMod approve all posts and comments)?)\r\n7. Can you receive PMs/modmail/chat messages? I've messaged you already. I can't get chat to work.\r\n8. If you have a snoo, we can view it even if you're suspended (which means we can see your account age, which subs you mod, etc.). Can you make a snoovatar? (Don't report this as a bug please)\r\n9. Can you report stuff? Can you try reporting [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/comments/gd36fc/hello_everyone_if_theres_anything_interesting/) and [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/comments/g42jfv/rreclassified_mods_removing_comments_yet_again/fuum01h/)?\r\n10. Can you \"get users help and support\"? Can you try it for my account?\r\n11. Can you receive the \"help and support\" message?

Can I ask you a few questions?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you receive orangereds? Do username mentions work for you? (I've mentioned you already.) If you mention someone else, do they receive an orangered?</li>\n<li>Can you accept mod invites? (I'm guessing yes, since testalt008 was able to do it)</li>\n<li>After you get modded, you can perform mod actions, right? (Like uploading images for the stylesheet, editing the subreddit settings, etc.) (I remember that testalt008 was able to mod WRD)</li>\n<li>All subreddits you create are insta-banned, correct? Can you try making /r/Banned_Subreddit with this in the description: \"Made by a shadowbanned user\"?</li>\n<li>Can you send PMs/modmail (as a regular user and as a mod)/chat messages? (I would think that you can't, since shadowbanning is usually done to prevent spam.) Can you try sending messages to my account cqtz and my subreddits /r/srname and /r/u_cqtz? Can you choose a subreddit of mine to be a mod of (I don't mod anything grandiose; just pick the one you like the best, I guess) and try sending modmail from it?</li>\n<li>You can be added as an approved user to a subreddit, right? Would that do anything in regards to your posts getting filtered or not? (Can you choose one of my subs to be an approved user of? Can you post/comment in that subreddit as well as another subreddit that I mod (note that /r/srname has AutoMod approve all posts and comments)?)</li>\n<li>Can you receive PMs/modmail/chat messages? I've messaged you already. I can't get chat to work.</li>\n<li>If you have a snoo, we can view it even if you're suspended (which means we can see your account age, which subs you mod, etc.). Can you make a snoovatar? (Don't report this as a bug please)</li>\n<li>Can you report stuff?
