Here\u2019s that post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/post/2ces/so-it-seems-saidit-host-kicked\">https://ruqqus.com/post/2ces/so-it-seems-saidit-host-kicked</a></p>\n<p>And here\u2019s the admin\u2019s confirmation that they were fine for now, but on very thin ice:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saidit.net/s/SaidIt/comments/65wr/reddit_is_flooding_saidit_with_hardcore/o255\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://saidit.net/s/SaidIt/comments/65wr/reddit_is_flooding_saidit_with_hardcore/o255</a></p>\n<p>And here\u2019s where (likely) AHS comes into play, spamming porn on the front page right when the Ice_Poseidon drama went down:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saidit.net/s/SaidIt/comments/65wr/reddit_is_flooding_saidit_with_hardcore/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://saidit.net/s/SaidIt/comments/65wr/reddit_is_flooding_saidit_with_hardcore/</a></p>\n<p>It\u2019s essentially confirmed that they tried to convince the host to drop Saidit by doing that. There are no AHS posts about Saidit so I have to assume that they kept it on the down low in the Discord, like the blatant false flagging of subs like PCM and MGTOW.</p>\n<p>This whole thing is a learning experience. Saidit just had a near death experience, they were very close to being shut down, likely for good.</p>\n<p>Ruqqus could easily have this happen. I think we\u2019re less radical and less well known than Saidit but we still have haters who want us gone. We need people on their a-game to prevent spam attacks like what happened to Saidit. Be vigilant. Another important thing is to keep your knowledge of who hosts the site out of the hands of the wrong people. If the question is asked, don\u2019t tell someone who is asking for who hosts the site. If AHS finds out they might come for us. Please be careful everyone.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for now.</p>\n<p>As always, watch out on Discord, and catch you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Here is the list for today:</p>\n<p>Very
