I basically looked at what tricks other subreddits used and tried to remember them, then looked at a CSS reference ([this one to be specific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)) to see if there was anything else I could use, and I also used Google. (The results that I look at are usually the ones from sites like CSS tricks or Stack Overflow. I think you've mentioned before that you usually can't find good results.
