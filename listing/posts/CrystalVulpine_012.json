I was born to be an average sheep who would still be using reddit and watching CNN right now.\r\n\r\nI'm only smart because I've thought too much. I became fed up with the establishment early in life and began questioning things. Otherwise I'd have never noticed anything. I also have many interests (and I suck at doing all of them). There's a difference between smart and genius. Smart is what you work for and accumulate over years of work, study, research, and practice. Anyone can become smart, and I'm very smart in many areas. However, I'm definitely not a genius. Genius is what you're born with, talent and intelligence. Geniuses have an instinct or intuition that allows them to start out 10x better at something without trying than the most hard-working non-genius will ever get to. Genius is a whole new level, and it's not available for everyone. Geniuses are naturally smart, and unfortunately as a smart person, especially in an open-source community full of these people, almost everyone I know is a genius. I can't do anything they can do. I'm a tryhard, a wannabe or whatever. My existence here, at least in the early stages of this site, is pointless. I simply didn't inherit the right genes for this type of thing, or most things I want to do. I just wasn't born for it.\r\n\r\nMost people here can do anything if they try even a little bit. Most active posters, even brand new ones, easily find 100s of great things in an hour, and super creative titles to go along with some of them. I on the other hand, despite 3 years of experience, can't manage to find more than one or two mediocre things in 2 hours that I haven't seen before. Most active commenters somehow find every single major post in the first 60 seconds and always get the top comments. Most devs here are true programmers, while I'm just a guy who copies and pastes things together and hopes it works. Even non-programmers completely blow me out of the water most of the time. And I've been at this for many years.\r\n\r\nMy problem is, I know a lot, but I'm dull. I'm the type who can pretend to be gifted, get good grades, etc. But when it really comes down to it, I'm nothing special. For example, you all are the people who can legitimately figure out a complicated math or science problem, whereas I can never do that. I have to be taught literally every step of everything, then I can copy it well enough, but never do it on my own. This is *crucial* for anything I want to accomplish myself; anytime I need to do something that's not been done before, I simply can't. I can't figure anything out. I can only copy others' methods. Yet you all have that genius instinct, to know how to do all these amazing things. I can't do that. I don't belong with you. You are all innovators. I am not, am uncreative, can't think outside the box, a talentless hack, etc. You are the people who make a difference. As for me, my only option is the usual college, job I hate, retire, then die, having nothing to do with my life. Try as I might, no amount of practice or desire will get me the talent I need to accomplish anything for real.\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not going to delete my account. But I'm not going to try and contribute as much anymore. It's pointless, a waste of time for me to try. You've all got it covered already.

I simply didn't inherit the right genes for this type of thing, or most things I want to do. I just wasn't born for it.</p>\n<p>Most people here can do anything if they try even a little bit. Most active posters, even brand new ones, easily find 100s of great things in an hour, and super creative titles to go along with some of them. I on the other hand, despite 3 years of experience, can't manage to find more than one or two mediocre things in 2 hours that I haven't seen before. Most active commenters somehow find every single major post in the first 60 seconds and always get the top comments. Most devs here are true programmers, while I'm just a guy who copies and pastes things together and hopes it works. Even non-programmers completely blow me out of the water most of the time. And I've been at this for many years.</p>\n<p>My problem is, I know a lot, but I'm dull. I'm the type who can pretend to be gifted, get good grades, etc. But when it really comes down to it, I'm nothing special. For example, you all are the people who can legitimately figure out a complicated math or science problem, whereas I can never do that. I have to be taught literally every step of everything, then I can copy it well enough, but never do it on my own. This is <em>crucial</em> for anything I want to accomplish myself; anytime I need to do something that's not been done before, I simply can't. I can't figure anything out. I can only copy others' methods. Yet you all have that genius instinct, to know how to do all these amazing things. I can't do that. I don't belong with you. You are all innovators. I am not, am uncreative, can't think outside the box, a talentless hack, etc. You are the people who make a difference. As for me, my only option is the usual college, job I hate, retire, then die, having nothing to do with my life. Try as I might, no amount of practice or desire will get me the talent I need to accomplish anything for real.</p>\n<p>No, I'm not going to delete my account. But I'm not going to try and contribute as much anymore. It's pointless, a waste of time for me to try. You've all got it covered already. I'll just be around as a less active, more normal user.</p>\n", "comment_count": 28, "created_utc": 1606968565, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_5eny", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1575480088, "description": "The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcbb No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udfea Ruqqus-related only.
