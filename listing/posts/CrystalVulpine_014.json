The only thing Europeans don't have a monopoly on as far as I can tell is classic literature.</p>\n<p>America is great and we have a better (notice I did not say good) government, more freedom, a better economy, and are the world's superpower, and without us the other countries couldn't survive. But I kinda feel like we as a whole are pretty stupid comparatively speaking. I don't think this is all laziness, because in America hard work seems to be a much bigger value, so I doubt it's any fault of our own. It's probably a genetic factor relating to our IQ that we can't control (which is very odd since most white Americans came from European ancestors, but it's what I've observed).</p>\n", "comment_count": 21, "created_utc": 1609895773, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 4, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_6ecc", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1581786138, "description": "Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Posts must be questions.
