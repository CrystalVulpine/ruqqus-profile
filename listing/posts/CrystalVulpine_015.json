Nothing is equal or fair, some people are golden and others aren't. Science has proven that the majority of these things are determined by genes, and a little bit by environmental factors you can't control. That leaves little room for you to have any say in the matter. Trying to succeed at something you don't have the talent for is just as impossible as becoming the opposite sex. People have fundamental differences fixed at birth that almost determine their abilities as well as every aspect about them, and those cannot be changed. And it's all just luck. And no, they're not \"unique but equal\", they really are better or worse than others.</p>\n", "comment_count": 31, "created_utc": 1610310514, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 6, "edited_utc": 1610312950, "fullname": "t2_6jma", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#7B9AE4", "created_utc": 1582833064, "description": "Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?
