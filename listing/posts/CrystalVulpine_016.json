I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas. All across the board it's been shown that girls are substantially better learners than boys, and have sharper and more active minds. Girls also have a *significant* advantage in the arts, languages, music, humanities, even just simple functions like memory and emotion. While still having a slight advantage even in \"male\" subjects like STEM. Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better. Males commit suicide 3.5x more despite supposedly having less depression (I suspect it's actually because depression is biologically hardwired into males so is rarely taken seriously for them, in fact \"whining\" about it is usually punished).\r\n\r\nIt's not just stereotypes and observational evidence though. Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies.

Marcion insisted on a literal interpretation of the old testament and believed that the creator and old testament god was an evil tyrant and lesser god opposed to the father of Christ. He and his followers were vegans, did not procreate, and had all kinds of ridiculous rules (ironic given their gripe about the old testament). Marcion also said Paul was the only apostle.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the church became reactionary and instead of being honest wrote these epistles for Paul to disprove Marcion. The entirety of the pastorals reads like a summary of Marcionism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>False teachers are forbidding eating certain foods and marriage (Marcionite veganism and anti-procreation) (1 Timothy 4:3) \"[false teachers] forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods which God created for use with thankfulness by the faithful and knowing of the truth\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seeking marriage is commanded and procreation and Roman family structure is the most central part of life, and church officials must both be husbands and have well-liked children (1 Timothy 3:4-5, Titus 1:5-6). In fact, bearing children is even set as a requirement for salvation (1 Timothy 2:15) \"But [women] will be saved by the bearing of children...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Women must be silent and submissive housewives and mothers (lots of women were high up in Marcion's assembly) (1 Timothy 2:11-2:14, 1 Timothy 5:14 and several other passages)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The law is portrayed in a very positive light and good works are essential (Marcion did not think highly of the OT law)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uses the \"shipwreck\" analogy (and Marcion was a ship trader) (1 Timothy 1:19).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complains about jewish myths constantly (Strange as it sounds, Marcion was called a Judaizer by the church fathers for his interpretation of the OT).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pastorals seem to teach the idea that Jesus was merely a man mediating for the OT God (to contrast with Marcion's belief that the OT God was separate from Christ's) (1 Timothy 2:5) \"For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the MAN Anointed Jesus\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know that Marcion was in error about a great many things. However it seems that the early church was more concerned with defeating their enemies than being honest. Instead, they wrote the pastoral epistles in the name of Marcion's favorite apostle, which simply proclaim everything the opposite of Marcion. This reactionary nature does not accurately represent Paul, so any attempt to claim it was one of his students writing for him does not stand. While Paul clearly disagreed with Marcion in many ways, in any case where Paul <em>does</em> agree with Marcion the pastorals disagree with him in order to disagree with Marcion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul never frowned upon marriage as did Marcion, but commended the unmarried as having done better, opposite of the pastoral theology (1 Corinthians 7)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul believed the OT law to be a stumbling block which leads to sin. It was fulfilled and freedom in Christ is emphasized (Romans 7).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul was not hesitant to hold women high regard or employ them in high positions (Romans 16)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul concerned himself not with the things of this world, but the next, assuring that this one is only a vapor in time and does not matter. \"Paul\" of the pastorals however was primarily concerned with conforming to Greco-Roman social norms, marriage &amp; procreation, organized church structure, and the affairs of this life.
