These exceptions include \"obscenity, fraud, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law\".

And now, the federalists have forced us to compromise to the point where they control two puppet parties and every politician to do their bidding. And they sent us into a state of moral panic to trick us into thinking it's \"necessary\" to save society. To the leftists, they say white men and muh racism and muh sexism and snowflakephobia is running rampant in everything, and the only way to stop it is to elect political tyrants who promise to crack down. To the right, they say society is infected with gays and trans and feminists and degenerates, and that they will destroy society, and the only way to stop it is to elect tyrannical politicians who will crack down. And it's all a lie, to keep the elites in power while controlling our lives and enjoying our tax dollars, and keep us distracted from it.
