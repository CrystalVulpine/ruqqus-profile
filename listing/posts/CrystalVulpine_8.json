Since then I have been seriously lacking in any creative ability whatsoever, nothing just comes to me anymore like it used to. However, for some reason I have retained the desire to do my usual things, despite having lost the ability. So I resort to thinking too hard about how to do something, and it just doesn't work without getting into the flow of it. This always bothered me, because it made the experience much more frustrating, and the results were never great.

I think what it all comes down to is that I have this mental block and they do not, so things still just come to them naturally.\r\n\r\nThis came on pretty much suddenly one day, which is why I don't agree with people who say it's depression. It also did not make me feel depressed at all, in fact sadness actually became *less* intense for me afterwards, probably due to the right side of my brain practically shutting off. The first sign of trouble was that everything seemed noticeably more bland and frustrating than before. I chalked it up to having a bad couple of days and figured things would return to normal, but as time went on this did not change. I did not notice this then, but looking back now this is also about the time that I became very bad at finishing anything properly, instead it always resulted in a huge mess of a project that was only half-finished. At around the same time, new ideas stopped popping into my head too, whereas before it was pretty much overflowing. I used to come up with so many bizarre stories and could not stop, and now I can't even if I try. Finally, I no longer had a \"taste\" in anything, that is making my creations attractive, enjoyable, and complete (for me more than anyone else), they're now just a forced together, unfinished, unattractive mess. I didn't have to think about stuff much before this, I just was able to do it like the others I've been talking about being so much better than me. And now I can't, I have to \"force\" it and that never works. My whole state of mind is completely different now. If it matters, I was going through puberty at the time this occurred.\r\n\r\nI've heard stories of things like writers block before and this seems like it but on a massive scale with every kind of subject. It kills me in programming, storytelling, art, math, science, music, humor, wording things, Minecraft, even making posts on reddit/ruqqus! It's very frustrating and has been going on for about a decade now with no end in sight. I can live with it but I'd *really* prefer a solution if there is one because I am not someone who likes to be bored and doing nothing all the time.
