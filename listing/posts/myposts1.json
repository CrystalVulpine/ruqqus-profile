This means it's not exactly its own text with a traditional original autograph and fixed copies of that, but one that's put together and evolves over time. Q was a collection of written material about Jesus based on oral traditions that was expanded over time. I propose that the final version of Q has been under our noses the whole time, and it's even in our bibles under the familiar title of *The Gospel According to Luke*.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that Luke was written first, perhaps by Mark or Matthew, both of whom the church fathers testify as writing down logia about Jesus out of order, as they came to them. This does not describe the gospels of Mark or Matthew, but it fits an early Q perfectly, which later became Luke. Church fathers also testify that Luke in particular was an absolute mess in the early days, which would be expected from this. The gospel of Mark was based on a very early version of Q/Luke and modified to suit a gentile audience. Matthew, then, must have been composed based on a version of Q at some point in between that of Mark and canonical Luke. The \"L\" material in Luke is merely content that had not yet been added to Q when Matthew or Mark used it for their gospels. Because of the layered composition of Q, the more primitive nature of Mark compared to canonical Luke does not bar Mark from having copied an earlier Luke. This is easily why Luke is more primitive in wording while Mark is more primitive in content.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Luke ever incorporated Mark; rather, Mark copied a very early, much shorter version of Luke. This makes sense, because [*very* little material is shared only between Luke and Mark, and that little bit is easily explained away by scribal harmonizations. Matthew, on the other hand, has a good chunk of Material shared between only itself and Mark.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Relationship_between_synoptic_gospels-en.svg/360px-Relationship_between_synoptic_gospels-en.svg.png) This implies that traditional Four-Source-Hypothesis of Mark, Q, and M is correct in Matthew's case, and that Matthew knew Mark and Q. But the \"Mark\" material in Luke is just the earlier parts original to Luke that Mark used as his source.\r\n\r\nThis resolves several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Double agreements: since Mark used Q/Luke as a source, that means most of it overlaps, and since both are used by Matthew, it's not surprising that he would sometimes opt for Luke over Mark. Yet this does not require Matthew to know a Luke like the one we have today, which we also know he didn't have.\r\n\r\n2. Luke seems to be the most common source material for other gospels besides just Matthew and Mark. This would make a lot of sense considering it would've been the grand collection of knowledge about Jesus.\r\n\r\n3. Luke is noticeably more Hebraic than the other gospels: Mark is more primitive because it's based on a much earlier Luke, but Luke is the most primitive in wording. \"Lukan priority\" cannot solve this since Mark clearly doesn't know most of Luke, but the concept of an evolving Q can. Much of the Lukan material might even be a direct translation of Hebrew and Aramaic sources, likely including Matthew's supposed Hebrew gospel. What's also interesting is that Shem Tob's Hebrew Matthew often agrees with Luke against Greek Matthew, even though it's Matthew's gospel!\r\n\r\n4. No church father mentions Q: they do, however, mention a lot of things about early Luke that resemble Q.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's still problems with this, but nothing that I can come up with. This, among other reasons, means that Luke is probably the most accurate gospel (though definitely not in terms of order, which they couldn't seem to decide on; and excluding the first two chapters as well as the anti-Marcionite revision by the author of Acts).","body_html":"<p>Many scholars believe Q was composed in layers.

Matthew, on the other hand, has a good chunk of Material shared between only itself and Mark.</a> This implies that traditional Four-Source-Hypothesis of Mark, Q, and M is correct in Matthew's case, and that Matthew knew Mark and Q. But the \"Mark\" material in Luke is just the earlier parts original to Luke that Mark used as his source.</p>\n<p>This resolves several problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Double agreements: since Mark used Q/Luke as a source, that means most of it overlaps, and since both are used by Matthew, it's not surprising that he would sometimes opt for Luke over Mark. Yet this does not require Matthew to know a Luke like the one we have today, which we also know he didn't have.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Luke seems to be the most common source material for other gospels besides just Matthew and Mark. This would make a lot of sense considering it would've been the grand collection of knowledge about Jesus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Luke is noticeably more Hebraic than the other gospels: Mark is more primitive because it's based on a much earlier Luke, but Luke is the most primitive in wording. \"Lukan priority\" cannot solve this since Mark clearly doesn't know most of Luke, but the concept of an evolving Q can. Much of the Lukan material might even be a direct translation of Hebrew and Aramaic sources, likely including Matthew's supposed Hebrew gospel. What's also interesting is that Shem Tob's Hebrew Matthew often agrees with Luke against Greek Matthew, even though it's Matthew's gospel!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No church father mentions Q: they do, however, mention a lot of things about early Luke that resemble Q.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm sure there's still problems with this, but nothing that I can come up with. This, among other reasons, means that Luke is probably the most accurate gospel (though definitely not in terms of order, which they couldn't seem to decide on; and excluding the first two chapters as well as the anti-Marcionite revision by the author of Acts).</p>\n","comment_count":0,"created_utc":1621907967,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_bl5z","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/bible/banner-1.png","color":"#30409F","created_utc":1593065817,"description":"About The Holy Bible - Scripture, Bible Study, Bible Stories...","description_html":"<p>About The Holy Bible - Scripture, Bible Study, Bible Stories...</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_1by","id":"1by","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Bible","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Bible","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/bible/profile-1.png"},"guild_id":"1by","guild_name":"Bible","herald_guild":null,"id":"bl5z","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Bible/post/bl5z/i-may-have-just-solved-the","score":1,"thumb_url":null,"title":"I may have just solved the synoptic problem","upvotes":1,"url":"","voted":0}

What's bizarre is that it often agrees with *Luke* over Matthew when using the Q source. Interesting, because often the Lukan version is more primitive and Hebraic than the Matthean version. I don't just mean minor details either. For example, the part where the people ask John what to do in chapter 3 is not extant in canonical Matthew, but it *is* in Luke...and a shorter version is also found in Hebrew Matthew! My guess is that Q was originally written in Hebrew, and that Shem Tob's text made use of this or padded it out with translations of the parts of Mark that were incorporated. And Matthew and Luke both made use of some sort of Greek translation of this document. More evidence is that the Shem Tob version also has several agreements with the gospel of Thomas over the canonical gospels, which also utilized Q.

Some manuscripts of the Old Latin and Old Syriac have similar variants.\r\n\r\nThe gospel of the Hebrews, too, looks like it made use of this document, or an extremely early version of Luke.

What's bizarre is that it often agrees with <em>Luke</em> over Matthew when using the Q source. Interesting, because often the Lukan version is more primitive and Hebraic than the Matthean version. I don't just mean minor details either. For example, the part where the people ask John what to do in chapter 3 is not extant in canonical Matthew, but it <em>is</em> in Luke...and a shorter version is also found in Hebrew Matthew!
