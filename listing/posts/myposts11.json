The first sign of trouble was that everything seemed noticeably more bland and frustrating than before.

I used to come up with so many bizarre stories and could not stop, and now I can't even if I try. Finally, I no longer had a \"taste\" in anything, that is making my creations attractive, enjoyable, and complete (for me more than anyone else), they're now just a forced together, unfinished, unattractive mess.

I can live with it but I'd <em>really</em> prefer a solution if there is one because I am not someone who likes to be bored and doing nothing all the time. I remember what it's like to always be doing so many interesting things which is probably why I still want to despite now lacking the ability.

It is not difficult. The transition from Java to C++ was easy and I'm not seeing what's \"so hard to understand\" about C++. Actually I think it's much easier to use than a lot of the so-called \"beginner\" languages such as *JavaScript*, which you pretty much have to be a fucking expert in to do even the simplest things >:(. But most people think C/C++ are so hard that they're afraid of them, and that they are to be avoided if at all possible! While the latter has a large standard library, on their own they're both fairly straightforward and self-explanatory languages, not unlike Java, C#, or Python, in fact they have less layers of abstraction than those which usually makes them even less complicated.
