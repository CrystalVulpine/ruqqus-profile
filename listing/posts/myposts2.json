Additionally, some of the oldest manuscripts of Matthew read \"Joseph begat Jesus\" and many current references to Joseph are \"Jesus's father\" in the oldest manuscripts. The genealogy in Matthew makes no sense if Mary conceived as a virgin, as it shows Joseph's line of descent, not Mary's, and the whole point is to show how Jesus came from the Davidic line. I have a theory however about why this story was added: the faithless church fathers, instead of believing because it is self-evident, either newly interpreted Isaiah 7:14 as messianic, or it was actually put there by Matthew, but the church fathers, due to a mistranslation in the LXX, thought it meant virgin when it was actually young woman (the same word is used for both). Either way, they lacked faith and only cared about creating a religious system to control people, and authored this story to \"prove\" it right. Ironically, the original Hebrew prophecy is only correct if Joseph is Jesus's (biological) father.

The entirety of the pastorals reads like a summary of Marcionism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>False teachers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>False teachers are forbidding eating certain foods and marriage (Marcionite veganism and anti-procreation) (1 Timothy 4:3)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seeking marriage is commanded and procreation and Roman family structure is the most central part of life. In fact, bearing children is even set as a requirement for salvation (1 Timothy 2:15).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Women must be silent and submissive housewives and mothers (lots of women were high up in Marcion's assembly)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The law is portrayed in a very positive light and good works are essential (Marcion did not think highly of the OT law)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uses the \"shipwreck\" analogy (Marcion was a ship trader).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complains about \"jewish myths\" constantly (Strange as it sounds, Marcion was accused of being a Judaizer for his interpretation of the OT).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pastorals seem to teach the idea that Jesus was merely a man mediating for the OT God (to contrast with Marcion's belief that the OT God was separate from Christ's) (1 Timothy 2:5)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know that Marcion was in error about a great many things. However it seems that the early church was more concerned with defeating their enemies than being honest. Instead, they wrote the pastoral epistles in the name of Marcion's favorite apostle, which simply proclaim everything the opposite of Marcion. This reactionary nature does not accurately represent Paul, so any attempt to claim it was one of his students writing for him does not stand. While Paul clearly disagreed with Marcion in many ways, in any case where Paul <em>does</em> agree with Marcion the pastorals disagree with him in order to disagree with Marcion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul never frowned upon marriage as did Marcion, but commended the unmarried as having done better, opposite of the pastoral theology (1 Corinthians 7)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul believed the OT law to be a stumbling block which leads to sin. It was fulfilled and freedom in Christ is emphasized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul was not hesitant to hold women high regard or employ them in high positions (Romans 16)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul concerned himself not with the things of this world, but the next, assuring that this one is only a vapor in time and does not matter. \"Paul\" of the pastorals however was primarily concerned with conforming to Greco-Roman social norms, marriage &amp; procreation, organized church structure, and the affairs of this life.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would not advise putting much trust in the pastoral epistles. They were not from a faithful follower but some reactionary church father. They teach several other problematic commands, such as abandoning widows and possibly even condoning slavery.</p>\n","comment_count":0,"created_utc":1613323330,"domain":"text post","downvotes":3,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_7miq","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1583035818,"description":"\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas.

Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies. They'd be happier and have more fun that way too.","body_html":"<p>Currently most successful people are men. So are the least.
