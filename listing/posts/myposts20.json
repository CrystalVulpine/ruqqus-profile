{"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "To other people, please don't quit using the site, it's great. Keep supporting it and using it until when and if it dies like reddit and digg did.\r\n\r\nI'm only making this post in case anyone wonders why I quit participating. I think for me, I need to give things some time to cool down. Ever since the beginning, the admins haven't really gotten along with me. Why, I don't think either of us know, they just didn't. But it's led to endless back and forth fighting and rants between us and I think it's best if I quit for some time. I still enjoy the shitposting and political discussions, but the community is no fun when I can't really do anything in it because of the hot water between me and the admins. I do think they've been a bit unfair to me, at least until I started ranting about them, but I also completely overreact about every little thing they do in response. So my goal is to leave the site long enough for this to blow over. I don't want these stupid grudges to destroy this site for me or anyone else. Hopefully by the time I'm back we'll both be in a better mood. I don't know how long that will be. It could be a week, months, or even a year or two. But I will check the site occasionally to try and determine the best time to return.\r\n\r\nI won't leave forever, but it could be a while. So if there's anything you want to tell me or ask me before hand, please do so (troll and abusive replies will be ignored). I'll answer this post for the rest of the day, and then I'll be leaving ruqqus for a bit. If you still need to contact me, I am on a few other sites, but be aware I'm not very active:\r\n\r\n* notabug.io: [\\@Vulptex](https://notabug.io/user/68he6XfT_r-WEEKNr5tJDfjlhvIYodz0NXaanCSCzMk.BItlDNfmEV4Y-n8turh-5XBNX8Ogr6xOIT3JGJufjpY) (You'll have to reply to one of my posts for this one, as there's no PM feature there yet).\r\n\r\n* saidit.net: [u/Vulptex](https://saidit.net/user/Vulptex)\r\n\r\n* Discord: the account with my name in the ruqqus server, but DMing me there is not ideal as discord doesn't let me use my PC for some reason and typing on mobile is difficult.\r\n\r\nI wish you all the best!\r\n\r\nEdit: I'll tell you what: I didn't realize so many people would miss my posts, so I'm not going to be quitting entirely now. (Thank you for the compliments!) But I will try to stay out of the admins' way as much as possible. I probably won't be quite as active for a while, but I'll still make some posts and have discussions.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I'll probably still give it about a week or two of rest, then I'll be back but try not to bother the admins for a while.

Keep supporting it and using it until when and if it dies like reddit and digg did.</p>\n<p>I'm only making this post in case anyone wonders why I quit participating. I think for me, I need to give things some time to cool down. Ever since the beginning, the admins haven't really gotten along with me. Why, I don't think either of us know, they just didn't. But it's led to endless back and forth fighting and rants between us and I think it's best if I quit for some time. I still enjoy the shitposting and political discussions, but the community is no fun when I can't really do anything in it because of the hot water between me and the admins. I do think they've been a bit unfair to me, at least until I started ranting about them, but I also completely overreact about every little thing they do in response. So my goal is to leave the site long enough for this to blow over. I don't want these stupid grudges to destroy this site for me or anyone else. Hopefully by the time I'm back we'll both be in a better mood. I don't know how long that will be. It could be a week, months, or even a year or two. But I will check the site occasionally to try and determine the best time to return.</p>\n<p>I won't leave forever, but it could be a while. So if there's anything you want to tell me or ask me before hand, please do so (troll and abusive replies will be ignored). I'll answer this post for the rest of the day, and then I'll be leaving ruqqus for a bit.

As an example, this post will also be hidden. That doesn't matter though since that would mean you already found and enabled this option.\\n\\nYou can also [block users](https://ruqqus.com/settings/blocks) who are causing you issues.\\n\\nMaybe someday you'll be able to make your own list of words and block guilds too, but the servers may not be ready for that yet. That way the admins don't have to ban stuff when too many people complain about it.","url":""}
