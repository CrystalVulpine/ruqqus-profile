Nobody thinks for themselves or has actual principles or ideology anymore, it's just \\\"copy the people on my side and do the opposite of the people on the other side\\\". Even worse, this is infiltrating things which have absolutely nothing to do with politics, and you must be on whichever side happens to invade them or you are not allowed. You can't be religious and liberal. You can't be anything other than having a perfect 1950s suburban family popping out babies constantly and be conservative. Even Christianity has *literally* become \\\"What does our preferred political party say?\\\" and that is NOT an exaggeration. Niche forums are being flooded with unrelated political discussions and anyone who dissents from the moderators' views is immediately permabanned. Coke is woke. Chick Fil A is anti-gay. Why the hell does even food have a political affiliation now? And everyone supports laws banning people who are not part of their political tribe. Even people who used to be sane are quickly changing their minds and focused on one thing only: winning and exterminating their opponent. They're all the fucking same and just why can't hardly anyone see through this crap?\\n\\nAnd before anyone calls this a popular opinion, I am aware that a lot of people do complain about this. But I rarely come across anyone who actually agrees, because I see maybe 1 in 10,000 people now who aren't 99.99% radically liberal or conservative. Not that those two words even mean anything anymore.","url":""}
