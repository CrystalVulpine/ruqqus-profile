CrystalVulpine says that Ali07 said the above statement because he wanted to know whether he can trust Bidpots to not visit the links.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried asking Bidpots a bit about this situation, and [apparently it went something like this](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nfi/ali07-got-banned-from-the-discord/jlnn):\r\n\r\n1. Ali07 was talking in #ruqqus-talk about his ban from discord/getting unbanned\r\n2. Bidpots and others joked about him having CP links, and Bidpots jokingly asked for links from him\r\n3. At some point, Ali07 sends [this message](https://i.ruqqus.com/comment/jjts/CTNh-_qyrJI)\r\n4. In the entire conversation, there was no mention of WRD or the \"CP attacks\" there whatsoever.\r\n5. Bidpots was banned for his jokes, but he was unbanned after captainmeta4 saw [this comment](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nbp/bidpots-went-a-little-over-the/jjv9?context=3)\r\n\r\nWhat I do not know: I do not know why Ali07 offered to send the screenshots in the first place, since Bidpots was just joking, and apparently /r/WatchRedditDie wasn't mentioned in their conversation. I tried looking at Bidpots and CrystalVulpine's conversation for more information, but it was kind of hard to follow.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn the past, Ali07 has been banned from the discord before for \"defending pedophilia\", but given that the [admins have a lot of \"anti-pedo\" rules](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/3sjt/posting-the-discord-antipedo-rules-spiel), I can't say for sure what he actually did.
