Unfortunately I overreacted about it initially so now the admins think I'm crazy and aren't taking my concerns seriously, however this has recently become a more widespread complaint for the Discord in particular, so hopefully they'll patch this up before it does any permanent damage.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594347403, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_2uwo", "guild_id": "2", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2uwo", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/10cn/youre-not-going-to-be-cool/2uwo", "post_id": "10cn", "score": 3, "upvotes": 4, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["2uwo"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/10cn/youre-not-going-to-be-cool/2vta", "post": {"author_name": "_Account_nyi", "award_count": 0, "body": "If you stick to your guns on this free speech shit, you're not going to be cool.
