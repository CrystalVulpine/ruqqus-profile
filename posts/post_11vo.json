You're not just an internet jannie now oh no you're FIGHTING RAYYYYYYCSIM and TRANNNNNNSNNAFLOOBABOOBLE and MISURGANY and all the stupid shit they pretend to care about because it lets them give themselves permission to kick you in the teeth.</p>\n<p>It wires your brain to make you an asshole, and to make you incapable of 1. recognizing when you're being an asshole and 2. ever not being an asshole because you've convinced yourself that being an asshole ACTUALLY makes you Harry Potter killing Voldemort with the power of love, and if Voldemort fights back the only possible course of action is for you to be an even bigger shithead.</p>\n<p>Un-digressing - It was important to have that neutral ground because metareddit shaped opinions about reddit, among the moderators and the people who talked to the moderators and the people who talked to the admins and eventually, the admins themselves. But from that point on it was just one subreddit after another turning into a divver-modded shithole, and then the right-leaning people would flee to a new sub where they could talk again, and then THAT would get taken over and turned into a divver shithole.
