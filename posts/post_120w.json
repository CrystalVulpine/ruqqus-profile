Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover.

This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though. Reddit is currently in a state of panic over the Ghislaine Maxwell situation. They want to do something to cover it up. This was leaked by 4chan and posted to r/conspiracy: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hok7fu/reddit_insider_on_4chan_claims_reddit_admins_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe the ban wave was to deflect attention because, according to TMOR, FurnitureGate, which is tangently related to the u/Maxwellhill situation, has made the news: https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/hou68m/reddit_top_minds_make_the_legitimate_news_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHopefully, in the midst of all of this, AHS is exposed to the broader public for what they are: pedophiles and supporters of pedophiles. And as such the admins, who are supporters of pedophilia.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, the admins have finally begun to admit that there is a power mod cabal, something @CrystalVulpine has said for a long time now.\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/post/11w4/the-admins-are-finally-starting-to\r\n\r\nThis could mean that the decline of Reddit happens quicker as the admins aren\u2019t afraid to show their power more.\r\n\r\nOne other thing he mentions is that Reddit may actually crack down on NSFW content, not just r/eyeblech and shit but actual porn. This is a hilariously bad idea for them but hey, the less traffic Reddit has the more we do.\r\n\r\nAnother tidbit from today, someone on r/reclassified said that AHS and TMOR are working with the SPLC, which makes a lot of sense, (and makes me want the SPLC investigated for pedophilia): https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/hordqk/ahs_refuses_to_acknowledge_their_misinformation/fxjl06p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nA final note is that the Ruqqus discord has more security now, you basically have to sign in on the welcome channel.\r\n\r\nAs always, watch out on Discord and catch you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHere is the list for today:\r\n\r\nVery High:\r\n\r\nr/ConsumeProduct*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor*\r\n\r\nr/ClericalFascism*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/smuggies*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers*\r\n\r\nr/DebateAltRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLawEnforcement*\u2020 -BANNED 6/30/20\r\n\r\nr/Shortcells*\u2020 -BANNED 6/26/20\r\n\r\nr/BruhFunny*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/ShitNeoconsSay*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BrapBarn*\u2020 -BANNED 6/8/20\r\n\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\nr/soyboys*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/imgoingtohellforthis2*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AltRightChristian*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad*\r\n\r\nr/The_Cabal*\r\n\r\nr/subredditcancer* -CLOSED 2/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeuxRAMA*\u2020 -BANNED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/Thank_China* -RESTRICTED 5/13/20\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever* -RESTRICTED 5/9/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLandlords*\r\n\r\nr/Chodi*\r\n\r\nr/TheHonkPill*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LockdownSkepticism*\r\n\r\nr/Plandemic*\r\n\r\nr/topnotchshitposting*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/cleanlivingkings*\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/Wuhan_Flu*\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/The_Congress* -CLOSED 6/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit* -PRIVATED 7/6/20\r\n\r\nr/DrainTheSwamp*\r\n\r\nr/itsafetish*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW*\r\n\r\nr/AdminCrickets*\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AgainstSubredditBans*\r\n\r\nr/ITears*\r\n\r\nr/yiffinhell*\u2020 -RUINED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/redditownsreddit*\r\n\r\nr/TheNewRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AZNIdentity*\r\n\r\nr/PresidentialRaceMemes*\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n\r\nr/TheRedPill\r\n\r\nr/IncelsWithoutHate*\r\n\r\nr/DarkHumorAndMemes*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeclineIntoCensorship*\r\n\r\nr/MLBStreams*\r\n\r\nr/eyeblech*\r\n\r\nr/badunitedkingdom\r\n\r\nr/FemaleDatingStrategy\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/TruFemcels* -PRIVATED 6/28/20\r\n\r\nr/FULLCOMMUNISM\r\n\r\nr/HiddenChangelog*\r\n\r\nr/MurderedByAdmins*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW2*\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/thomasjefferson* -CLOSED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/Drama\r\n\r\nr/redditmoment\r\n\r\nr/Terfisaslur\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/undelete\r\n\r\nr/NoLockedThreads\r\n\r\nr/HiddenPolicy*\r\n\r\nr/WorstOfModeration*\r\n\r\nr/ModsBeingDicks*\r\n\r\nr/RedditCensors*\r\n\r\nr/TrueLesbians\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/China_Flu\r\n\r\nNot in danger, for now, however, some of these subs may not see 2021, these subs all have less than a 10% chance of being banned in this wave:\r\n\r\nr/SocialJusticeInAction\r\n\r\nr/WikipediaInAction\r\n\r\nr/TumblrInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction2\r\n\r\nr/CringeTopia\r\n\r\nr/NoahGetTheBoat\r\n\r\nr/Shuffles_Deck\r\n\r\nr/FreeSpeech\r\n\r\nr/BestOfLiveLeak\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/MoreTankieChapo\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/banned\r\n\r\nr/worldpolitics\r\n\r\nr/EverythingFoxes -CLOSED 6/2/20\r\n\r\nr/awwaf -CLOSED 4/20/20\r\n\r\nr/conspiracy\r\n\r\nr/Conservative\r\n\r\nr/ShitPoliticsSays\r\n\r\nr/anarcho_capitalism\r\n\r\nr/4chan\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyretard\r\n\r\nr/metacanada\r\n\r\nr/MensRights\r\n\r\nr/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\r\n\r\nr/PussyPassDenied\r\n\r\nr/PussyPass\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WGTOW\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalHorrorStory\r\n\r\nr/Trump\r\n\r\nr/Walkaway\r\n\r\nr/WhiteBeauty\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BeatMeatToIt\r\n\r\nr/AgainstKarmaWhores\r\n\r\nr/PewdiepieSubmissions\r\n\r\nr/EnoughCommieSpam\r\n\r\nr/Enough_AOC_Spam\r\n\r\nr/drumpfisfinished\r\n\r\nr/FreeKarma4U\r\n\r\nr/GodWeeps\r\n\r\nSubs that won\u2019t get banned because they are useful to the admins:\r\n\r\nr/AgainstDegenerateSubs\r\n\r\nr/reclassified\r\n\r\nr/ShadowBan\r\n\r\nr/CommentRemovalChecker -RESTRICTED TO A BOT, RUNS SYNDICATED TO R/SHADOWBAN\r\n\r\nr/RedditAlternatives\r\n\r\n\u2020 = Banned (RIP)\r\n\r\nAsterisk = >50% chance of being banned by Election Day", "body_html": "<p>Ruqqus only.</p>\n<p>Wow, just like the coronavirus, the second we forgot about the first wave the second wave hits.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.</p>\n<p>First up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.</p>\n<p>Here is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>There were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.</p>\n<p>Some of the biggest surprises were:</p>\n<p>r/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.</p>\n<p>r/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.</p>\n<p>Most of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.</p>\n<p>Some subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:</p>\n<p>r/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.</p>\n<p>r/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.</p>\n<p>r/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.</p>\n<p>r/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.</p>\n<p>In terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.</p>\n<p>r/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though. Reddit is currently in a state of panic over the Ghislaine Maxwell situation. They want to do something to cover it up. This was leaked by 4chan and posted to r/conspiracy: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hok7fu/reddit_insider_on_4chan_claims_reddit_admins_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe the ban wave was to deflect attention because, according to TMOR, FurnitureGate, which is tangently related to the u/Maxwellhill situation, has made the news: https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/hou68m/reddit_top_minds_make_the_legitimate_news_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHopefully, in the midst of all of this, AHS is exposed to the broader public for what they are: pedophiles and supporters of pedophiles. And as such the admins, who are supporters of pedophilia.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, the admins have finally begun to admit that there is a power mod cabal, something @CrystalVulpine has said for a long time now.\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/post/11w4/the-admins-are-finally-starting-to\r\n\r\nThis could mean that the decline of Reddit happens quicker as the admins aren\u2019t afraid to show their power more.\r\n\r\nOne other thing he mentions is that Reddit may actually crack down on NSFW content, not just r/eyeblech and shit but actual porn. This is a hilariously bad idea for them but hey, the less traffic Reddit has the more we do.\r\n\r\nAnother tidbit from today, someone on r/reclassified said that AHS and TMOR are working with the SPLC, which makes a lot of sense, (and makes me want the SPLC investigated for pedophilia): https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/hordqk/ahs_refuses_to_acknowledge_their_misinformation/fxjl06p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nA final note is that the Ruqqus discord has more security now, you basically have to sign in on the welcome channel.\r\n\r\nAs always, watch out on Discord and catch you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHere is the list for today:\r\n\r\nVery High:\r\n\r\nr/ConsumeProduct*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor*\r\n\r\nr/ClericalFascism*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/smuggies*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers*\r\n\r\nr/DebateAltRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLawEnforcement*\u2020 -BANNED 6/30/20\r\n\r\nr/Shortcells*\u2020 -BANNED 6/26/20\r\n\r\nr/BruhFunny*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/ShitNeoconsSay*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BrapBarn*\u2020 -BANNED 6/8/20\r\n\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\nr/soyboys*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/imgoingtohellforthis2*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AltRightChristian*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad*\r\n\r\nr/The_Cabal*\r\n\r\nr/subredditcancer* -CLOSED 2/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeuxRAMA*\u2020 -BANNED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/Thank_China* -RESTRICTED 5/13/20\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever* -RESTRICTED 5/9/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLandlords*\r\n\r\nr/Chodi*\r\n\r\nr/TheHonkPill*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LockdownSkepticism*\r\n\r\nr/Plandemic*\r\n\r\nr/topnotchshitposting*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/cleanlivingkings*\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/Wuhan_Flu*\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/The_Congress* -CLOSED 6/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit* -PRIVATED 7/6/20\r\n\r\nr/DrainTheSwamp*\r\n\r\nr/itsafetish*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW*\r\n\r\nr/AdminCrickets*\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AgainstSubredditBans*\r\n\r\nr/ITears*\r\n\r\nr/yiffinhell*\u2020 -RUINED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/redditownsreddit*\r\n\r\nr/TheNewRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AZNIdentity*\r\n\r\nr/PresidentialRaceMemes*\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n\r\nr/TheRedPill\r\n\r\nr/IncelsWithoutHate*\r\n\r\nr/DarkHumorAndMemes*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeclineIntoCensorship*\r\n\r\nr/MLBStreams*\r\n\r\nr/eyeblech*\r\n\r\nr/badunitedkingdom\r\n\r\nr/FemaleDatingStrategy\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/TruFemcels* -PRIVATED 6/28/20\r\n\r\nr/FULLCOMMUNISM\r\n\r\nr/HiddenChangelog*\r\n\r\nr/MurderedByAdmins*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW2*\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/thomasjefferson* -CLOSED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/Drama\r\n\r\nr/redditmoment\r\n\r\nr/Terfisaslur\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/undelete\r\n\r\nr/NoLockedThreads\r\n\r\nr/HiddenPolicy*\r\n\r\nr/WorstOfModeration*\r\n\r\nr/ModsBeingDicks*\r\n\r\nr/RedditCensors*\r\n\r\nr/TrueLesbians\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/China_Flu\r\n\r\nNot in danger, for now, however, some of these subs may not see 2021, these subs all have less than a 10% chance of being banned in this wave:\r\n\r\nr/SocialJusticeInAction\r\n\r\nr/WikipediaInAction\r\n\r\nr/TumblrInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction2\r\n\r\nr/CringeTopia\r\n\r\nr/NoahGetTheBoat\r\n\r\nr/Shuffles_Deck\r\n\r\nr/FreeSpeech\r\n\r\nr/BestOfLiveLeak\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/MoreTankieChapo\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/banned\r\n\r\nr/worldpolitics\r\n\r\nr/EverythingFoxes -CLOSED 6/2/20\r\n\r\nr/awwaf -CLOSED 4/20/20\r\n\r\nr/conspiracy\r\n\r\nr/Conservative\r\n\r\nr/ShitPoliticsSays\r\n\r\nr/anarcho_capitalism\r\n\r\nr/4chan\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyretard\r\n\r\nr/metacanada\r\n\r\nr/MensRights\r\n\r\nr/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\r\n\r\nr/PussyPassDenied\r\n\r\nr/PussyPass\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WGTOW\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalHorrorStory\r\n\r\nr/Trump\r\n\r\nr/Walkaway\r\n\r\nr/WhiteBeauty\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BeatMeatToIt\r\n\r\nr/AgainstKarmaWhores\r\n\r\nr/PewdiepieSubmissions\r\n\r\nr/EnoughCommieSpam\r\n\r\nr/Enough_AOC_Spam\r\n\r\nr/drumpfisfinished\r\n\r\nr/FreeKarma4U\r\n\r\nr/GodWeeps\r\n\r\nSubs that won\u2019t get banned because they are useful to the admins:\r\n\r\nr/AgainstDegenerateSubs\r\n\r\nr/reclassified\r\n\r\nr/ShadowBan\r\n\r\nr/CommentRemovalChecker -RESTRICTED TO A BOT, RUNS SYNDICATED TO R/SHADOWBAN\r\n\r\nr/RedditAlternatives\r\n\r\n\u2020 = Banned (RIP)\r\n\r\nAsterisk = >50% chance of being banned by Election Day", "body_html": "<p>Ruqqus only.</p>\n<p>Wow, just like the coronavirus, the second we forgot about the first wave the second wave hits.

This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.</p>\n<p>Most of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.</p>\n<p>Some subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:</p>\n<p>r/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.</p>\n<p>r/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.</p>\n<p>r/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.</p>\n<p>r/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.</p>\n<p>In terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.</p>\n<p>r/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.</p>\n<p>First up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.</p>\n<p>Here is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>There were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.</p>\n<p>Some of the biggest surprises were:</p>\n<p>r/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.</p>\n<p>r/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.</p>\n<p>Most of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.</p>\n<p>Some subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:</p>\n<p>r/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.</p>\n<p>r/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.</p>\n<p>r/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.</p>\n<p>r/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.</p>\n<p>In terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.</p>\n<p>r/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though.

Holy shit was this a shock to my system. Lots to cover. My list just got a lot thinner, and it pretty much closed the door on TERF, LGB activist, and offensive/edgy meme subs on Reddit.\r\n\r\nFirst up, the ban wave itself. This second wave consisted of mainly TERF and abuse fetish subs. They took down about an equal number of each and it honestly felt like the abuse porn only went down because the admins didn\u2019t want to appear misogynistic (as they are). It\u2019s the EXACT same thing as the admins only banning CTH to not seem biased. There was also a lot of incest and rape porn subs that were quarantined.\r\n\r\nHere is a pinned SRD post covering a majority of the banned subs: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hov0oa/ban_wave_part_2_has_hit_discuss_this_dramatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThere were a few subs that were completely unsurprising, like LGBDropTheT, itsafetish, and MoreTankieChapo, but others, were very surprising and there are some subs I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest surprises were:\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi: Yeah this one seems completely out of left field in the context of everything. This, okbuddyanarchy, and Darkhumorandmemesv2 were among the only edgy subs banned, and being honest, this sub wasn\u2019t as edgy as DHAM, and I only found a single AHS post about it and that post was about a bunch of edgy subs. Out of all of them this is the only one that made me sad, as I liked the sub and it probably means an end to edgy humor on Reddit.\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyanarchy: Same deal here. This sub had been quarantined mind you, and was the only quarantined sub that got banned. No AHS posts about it and very under the radar.\r\n\r\nMost of the abuse porn subs: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised they actually did it and tried to be \u201cfair\u201d to the TERFs. Most of these were banned for promoting hate too and NOT violent content (although the rest were) so that\u2019s also surprising.\r\n\r\nSome subs that didn\u2019t get banned that surprise me:\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism: Yeah considering Terfisaslur and TrueLesbians got banned yeah this one is surprising, I don\u2019t expect they have long though.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS will not stop bitching about them, maybe Reddit doesn\u2019t wanna seem racist towards Indians if they ban them? (They are). They also don\u2019t have long.\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers: This sub seemed like it would absolutely be a victim in round one, so the fact that it lived through round two too is very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit: Only survived because it was private.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sub bans for the rest of July I predict a third wave before the month ends, probably around July 20, and I think the three I just mentioned (minus maybe WeekendGunnit) and possibly averageredditor, DrainTheSwamp, and LoveForLandlords. PCM and WRD aren\u2019t out of the question but I think they\u2019ll get saved for the next big wave. I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.\r\n\r\nr/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the only news for today though. Reddit is currently in a state of panic over the Ghislaine Maxwell situation. They want to do something to cover it up. This was leaked by 4chan and posted to r/conspiracy: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hok7fu/reddit_insider_on_4chan_claims_reddit_admins_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHmm, maybe the ban wave was to deflect attention because, according to TMOR, FurnitureGate, which is tangently related to the u/Maxwellhill situation, has made the news: https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/hou68m/reddit_top_minds_make_the_legitimate_news_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nHopefully, in the midst of all of this, AHS is exposed to the broader public for what they are: pedophiles and supporters of pedophiles. And as such the admins, who are supporters of pedophilia.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, the admins have finally begun to admit that there is a power mod cabal, something @CrystalVulpine has said for a long time now.\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/post/11w4/the-admins-are-finally-starting-to\r\n\r\nThis could mean that the decline of Reddit happens quicker as the admins aren\u2019t afraid to show their power more.\r\n\r\nOne other thing he mentions is that Reddit may actually crack down on NSFW content, not just r/eyeblech and shit but actual porn. This is a hilariously bad idea for them but hey, the less traffic Reddit has the more we do.\r\n\r\nAnother tidbit from today, someone on r/reclassified said that AHS and TMOR are working with the SPLC, which makes a lot of sense, (and makes me want the SPLC investigated for pedophilia): https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/hordqk/ahs_refuses_to_acknowledge_their_misinformation/fxjl06p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nA final note is that the Ruqqus discord has more security now, you basically have to sign in on the welcome channel.\r\n\r\nAs always, watch out on Discord and catch you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHere is the list for today:\r\n\r\nVery High:\r\n\r\nr/ConsumeProduct*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor*\r\n\r\nr/ClericalFascism*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/smuggies*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers*\r\n\r\nr/DebateAltRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLawEnforcement*\u2020 -BANNED 6/30/20\r\n\r\nr/Shortcells*\u2020 -BANNED 6/26/20\r\n\r\nr/BruhFunny*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/ShitNeoconsSay*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BrapBarn*\u2020 -BANNED 6/8/20\r\n\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\nr/soyboys*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/imgoingtohellforthis2*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AltRightChristian*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad*\r\n\r\nr/The_Cabal*\r\n\r\nr/subredditcancer* -CLOSED 2/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeuxRAMA*\u2020 -BANNED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/Thank_China* -RESTRICTED 5/13/20\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever* -RESTRICTED 5/9/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLandlords*\r\n\r\nr/Chodi*\r\n\r\nr/TheHonkPill*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LockdownSkepticism*\r\n\r\nr/Plandemic*\r\n\r\nr/topnotchshitposting*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/cleanlivingkings*\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/Wuhan_Flu*\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/The_Congress* -CLOSED 6/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit* -PRIVATED 7/6/20\r\n\r\nr/DrainTheSwamp*\r\n\r\nr/itsafetish*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW*\r\n\r\nr/AdminCrickets*\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AgainstSubredditBans*\r\n\r\nr/ITears*\r\n\r\nr/yiffinhell*\u2020 -RUINED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/redditownsreddit*\r\n\r\nr/TheNewRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AZNIdentity*\r\n\r\nr/PresidentialRaceMemes*\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n\r\nr/TheRedPill\r\n\r\nr/IncelsWithoutHate*\r\n\r\nr/DarkHumorAndMemes*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeclineIntoCensorship*\r\n\r\nr/MLBStreams*\r\n\r\nr/eyeblech*\r\n\r\nr/badunitedkingdom\r\n\r\nr/FemaleDatingStrategy\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/TruFemcels* -PRIVATED 6/28/20\r\n\r\nr/FULLCOMMUNISM\r\n\r\nr/HiddenChangelog*\r\n\r\nr/MurderedByAdmins*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW2*\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/thomasjefferson* -CLOSED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/Drama\r\n\r\nr/redditmoment\r\n\r\nr/Terfisaslur\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/undelete\r\n\r\nr/NoLockedThreads\r\n\r\nr/HiddenPolicy*\r\n\r\nr/WorstOfModeration*\r\n\r\nr/ModsBeingDicks*\r\n\r\nr/RedditCensors*\r\n\r\nr/TrueLesbians\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/China_Flu\r\n\r\nNot in danger, for now, however, some of these subs may not see 2021, these subs all have less than a 10% chance of being banned in this wave:\r\n\r\nr/SocialJusticeInAction\r\n\r\nr/WikipediaInAction\r\n\r\nr/TumblrInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction2\r\n\r\nr/CringeTopia\r\n\r\nr/NoahGetTheBoat\r\n\r\nr/Shuffles_Deck\r\n\r\nr/FreeSpeech\r\n\r\nr/BestOfLiveLeak\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/MoreTankieChapo\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/banned\r\n\r\nr/worldpolitics\r\n\r\nr/EverythingFoxes -CLOSED 6/2/20\r\n\r\nr/awwaf -CLOSED 4/20/20\r\n\r\nr/conspiracy\r\n\r\nr/Conservative\r\n\r\nr/ShitPoliticsSays\r\n\r\nr/anarcho_capitalism\r\n\r\nr/4chan\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyretard\r\n\r\nr/metacanada\r\n\r\nr/MensRights\r\n\r\nr/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\r\n\r\nr/PussyPassDenied\r\n\r\nr/PussyPass\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WGTOW\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalHorrorStory\r\n\r\nr/Trump\r\n\r\nr/Walkaway\r\n\r\nr/WhiteBeauty\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BeatMeatToIt\r\n\r\nr/AgainstKarmaWhores\r\n\r\nr/PewdiepieSubmissions\r\n\r\nr/EnoughCommieSpam\r\n\r\nr/Enough_AOC_Spam\r\n\r\nr/drumpfisfinished\r\n\r\nr/FreeKarma4U\r\n\r\nr/GodWeeps\r\n\r\nSubs that won\u2019t get banned because they are useful to the admins:\r\n\r\nr/AgainstDegenerateSubs\r\n\r\nr/reclassified\r\n\r\nr/ShadowBan\r\n\r\nr/CommentRemovalChecker -RESTRICTED TO A BOT, RUNS SYNDICATED TO R/SHADOWBAN\r\n\r\nr/RedditAlternatives\r\n\r\n\u2020 = Banned (RIP)\r\n\r\nAsterisk = >50% chance of being banned by Election Day", "body_html": "<p>Ruqqus only.</p>\n<p>Wow, just like the coronavirus, the second we forgot about the first wave the second wave hits.

I predict if it\u2019s a massive wave it\u2019ll be when PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, and possibly even 4chan and Drama go.</p>\n<p>r/detrans was briefly banned and then unbanned, one Redditor told r/reclassified she\u2019d seen a lot of false reporting recently, likely from AHS/TMOR and the cabal: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/how0qp/rdetrans_gets_spammed_with_false_reports_a_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the only news for today though. Reddit is currently in a state of panic over the Ghislaine Maxwell situation. They want to do something to cover it up. This was leaked by 4chan and posted to r/conspiracy: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hok7fu/reddit_insider_on_4chan_claims_reddit_admins_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hok7fu/reddit_insider_on_4chan_claims_reddit_admins_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>Hmm, maybe the ban wave was to deflect attention because, according to TMOR, FurnitureGate, which is tangently related to the u/Maxwellhill situation, has made the news: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/hou68m/reddit_top_minds_make_the_legitimate_news_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/hou68m/reddit_top_minds_make_the_legitimate_news_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>Hopefully, in the midst of all of this, AHS is exposed to the broader public for what they are: pedophiles and supporters of pedophiles. And as such the admins, who are supporters of pedophilia.</p>\n<p>One more thing, the admins have finally begun to admit that there is a power mod cabal, something <a href=\"/@CrystalVulpine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@CrystalVulpine/pic/profile\"/>@CrystalVulpine</a> has said for a long time now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/post/11w4/the-admins-are-finally-starting-to\">https://ruqqus.com/post/11w4/the-admins-are-finally-starting-to</a></p>\n<p>This could mean that the decline of Reddit happens quicker as the admins aren\u2019t afraid to show their power more.</p>\n<p>One other thing he mentions is that Reddit may actually crack down on NSFW content, not just r/eyeblech and shit but actual porn. This is a hilariously bad idea for them but hey, the less traffic Reddit has the more we do.</p>\n<p>Another tidbit from today, someone on r/reclassified said that AHS and TMOR are working with the SPLC, which makes a lot of sense, (and makes me want the SPLC investigated for pedophilia): <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reclassified/comments/hordqk/ahs_refuses_to_acknowledge_their_misinformation/fxjl06p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow
