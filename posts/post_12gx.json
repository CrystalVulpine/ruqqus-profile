There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.</p>\n<p>Issue #2: <strong>Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>False</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so <em>right now</em> no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach. I probably won't ask to be modded in the Discord as I barely use it, but I'll certainly help them set up a system that's as fair as possible.

There is no actual way to begin as a mod right now, however the admins are planning on creating one in the future.</p>\n<p>Issue #4: <strong>Are the admins coordinating them to post PSAs in <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a> and officially answer questions?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>False</strong></p>\n<p>This one surprised me, because so many people were making those posts in the exact same format, including the discord mods. So it would make sense if the admins had a group of users making official announcements and answering questions. As it turns out though, someone just made a PSA post and everyone else copied it. I did this myself but I'm weird that way so I thought I was the exception. Apparently I'm not as weird as I thought.</p>\n<p>Issue #5: <strong>Were these mods chosen for other roles on Ruqqus?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>Mostly false</strong></p>\n<p>There is no trusted user system yet, although I've heard there may be plans for one, but that will likely be after there's a real initiation process. The only exception was that 2 of them were made guildmasters of <a href=\"/+WatchRedditDie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+WatchRedditDie/pic/profile\"/>+WatchRedditDie</a> for completely unrelated reasons. However, if and when this feature does get added there will likely be a lot of overlap between trusted users and the Discord mods.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>So yeah, they still have a flawed system, but it's better than we thought it was. Either way there is nothing devious occurring, just a few oversights by the admins as well as actions taken in a hurry. All I'll say now is to make the discord mod discussion open to all users of the server, with no private chats for anyone but the admins (not mods), and to develop a real way for people to become mods before the current system causes any permanent damage to Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>About some of them also modding WRD: This alarmed me at first because the Discord struck me as a second instance of the admins picking favorites for assistant roles. The initial modding in WRD made sense since they were active in the guild and were also mods on WRD on reddit. But when they were also added on the Discord too it set off the cabal alarm that I have installed in my mind now (thanks to DefaultMods).

If someone asks to be a mod and they've shown themselves to be trustworthy you invite them to mod, it's very simple.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594483022, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_3576", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1575480088, "description": "The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcbb No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udfea Ruqqus-related only.

Apparently it's only for mod stuff, like how to structure the server and channels and roles and rules and such. Personally I still am uncomfortable with that as I think since Ruqqus isn't supposed to be a bureaucracy/dictatorship, these kinds of things should be public if there are any non-admin users involved, especially considering that the Discord server is an official affiliation to Ruqqus and there's currently no possible way to earn mod status there. There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.\r\n\r\nIssue #2: **Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so *right now* no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach. I probably won't ask to be modded in the Discord as I barely use it, but I'll certainly help them set up a system that's as fair as possible. This also applies for any \"trusted user\" system the admins might implement in the future for Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nIssue #3: **Is there currently no possible way for other users to become a mod no matter how constructive they are?**    \r\nStatus: **Mostly True**\r\n\r\nAs said in the previous explanation, the current mods were added based on users' suggestions during a period where it had to be done swiftly because the server was being overloaded. There is no actual way to begin as a mod right now, however the admins are planning on creating one in the future.\r\n\r\nIssue #4: **Are the admins coordinating them to post PSAs in +Ruqqus and officially answer questions?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nThis one surprised me, because so many people were making those posts in the exact same format, including the discord mods. So it would make sense if the admins had a group of users making official announcements and answering questions. As it turns out though, someone just made a PSA post and everyone else copied it. I did this myself but I'm weird that way so I thought I was the exception. Apparently I'm not as weird as I thought.\r\n\r\nIssue #5: **Were these mods chosen for other roles on Ruqqus?**    \r\nStatus: **Mostly false**\r\n\r\nThere is no trusted user system yet, although I've heard there may be plans for one, but that will likely be after there's a real initiation process. The only exception was that 2 of them were made guildmasters of +WatchRedditDie for completely unrelated reasons. However, if and when this feature does get added there will likely be a lot of overlap between trusted users and the Discord mods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo yeah, they still have a flawed system, but it's better than we thought it was. Either way there is nothing devious occurring, just a few oversights by the admins as well as actions taken in a hurry. All I'll say now is to make the discord mod discussion open to all users of the server, with no private chats for anyone but the admins (not mods), and to develop a real way for people to become mods before the current system causes any permanent damage to Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nAbout some of them also modding WRD: This alarmed me at first because the Discord struck me as a second instance of the admins picking favorites for assistant roles.

Apparently it's only for mod stuff, like how to structure the server and channels and roles and rules and such. Personally I still am uncomfortable with that as I think since Ruqqus isn't supposed to be a bureaucracy/dictatorship, these kinds of things should be public if there are any non-admin users involved, especially considering that the Discord server is an official affiliation to Ruqqus and there's currently no possible way to earn mod status there. There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.\r\n\r\nIssue #2: **Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so *right now* no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach.

Regular mods should not be having private any chats with the admins nor should they able to see or do things normally limited to admins. The discussion channel, however, would be ineffective if the final say is always up to the same few mods.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea that people should 'earn' mod status</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That would be ideal however getting rid of it is not a viable solution right now. There are only 3 admins who are all busy with other stuff. So the only other fair solution is to allow for people to become mods.</p>\n<p>Personally I think the admins should just break the Discord server's ties with Ruqqus altogether, then we wouldn't be having these issues since anyone could always just make another server if they don't like how one is being run. That includes not using the server for internal things like ban appeals and any private conversations with the admins.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594484963, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1594485114, "fullname": "t3_35dn", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1575480088, "description": "The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcbb No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udfea Ruqqus-related only.

There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time.

The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach.

Apparently it's only for mod stuff, like how to structure the server and channels and roles and rules and such. Personally I still am uncomfortable with that as I think since Ruqqus isn't supposed to be a bureaucracy/dictatorship, these kinds of things should be public if there are any non-admin users involved, especially considering that the Discord server is an official affiliation to Ruqqus and there's currently no possible way to earn mod status there. There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.</p>\n<p>Issue #2: <strong>Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>False</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so <em>right now</em> no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach.

The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach.

I'm paranoid about this because the past 2 years have made me develop ultra-high sensitivity cabal detectors, but a some of my suspicions were correct. I hope that this post will resolve any questions or concerns anyone may have had regarding this issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIssue #1: **Do these mods have private discussion channels with the admins?**    \r\nStatus: **True!**\r\n\r\nIt has been officially confirmed now that the admins and discord mods do indeed have a private chat room together. Apparently it's only for mod stuff, like how to structure the server and channels and roles and rules and such. Personally I still am uncomfortable with that as I think since Ruqqus isn't supposed to be a bureaucracy/dictatorship, these kinds of things should be public if there are any non-admin users involved, especially considering that the Discord server is an official affiliation to Ruqqus and there's currently no possible way to earn mod status there. There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.\r\n\r\nIssue #2: **Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so *right now* no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach. I probably won't ask to be modded in the Discord as I barely use it, but I'll certainly help them set up a system that's as fair as possible. This also applies for any \"trusted user\" system the admins might implement in the future for Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nIssue #3: **Is there currently no possible way for other users to become a mod no matter how constructive they are?**    \r\nStatus: **Mostly True**\r\n\r\nAs said in the previous explanation, the current mods were added based on users' suggestions during a period where it had to be done swiftly because the server was being overloaded. There is no actual way to begin as a mod right now, however the admins are planning on creating one in the future.\r\n\r\nIssue #4: **Are the admins coordinating them to post PSAs in +Ruqqus and officially answer questions?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nThis one surprised me, because so many people were making those posts in the exact same format, including the discord mods. So it would make sense if the admins had a group of users making official announcements and answering questions. As it turns out though, someone just made a PSA post and everyone else copied it. I did this myself but I'm weird that way so I thought I was the exception. Apparently I'm not as weird as I thought.\r\n\r\nIssue #5: **Were these mods chosen for other roles on Ruqqus?**    \r\nStatus: **Mostly false**\r\n\r\nThere is no trusted user system yet, although I've heard there may be plans for one, but that will likely be after there's a real initiation process. The only exception was that 2 of them were made guildmasters of +WatchRedditDie for completely unrelated reasons. However, if and when this feature does get added there will likely be a lot of overlap between trusted users and the Discord mods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo yeah, they still have a flawed system, but it's better than we thought it was. Either way there is nothing devious occurring, just a few oversights by the admins as well as actions taken in a hurry. All I'll say now is to make the discord mod discussion open to all users of the server, with no private chats for anyone but the admins (not mods), and to develop a real way for people to become mods before the current system causes any permanent damage to Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nAbout some of them also modding WRD: This alarmed me at first because the Discord struck me as a second instance of the admins picking favorites for assistant roles. The initial modding in WRD made sense since they were active in the guild and were also mods on WRD on reddit. But when they were also added on the Discord too it set off the cabal alarm that I have installed in my mind now (thanks to DefaultMods). What really happened was that they were suggested by the users of the Discord to be mods because they were active there too, so it was just a very odd coincidence.

There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.\r\n\r\nIssue #2: **Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?**    \r\nStatus: **False**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so *right now* no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach. I probably won't ask to be modded in the Discord as I barely use it, but I'll certainly help them set up a system that's as fair as possible.

So it would make sense if the admins had a group of users making official announcements and answering questions. As it turns out though, someone just made a PSA post and everyone else copied it. I did this myself but I'm weird that way so I thought I was the exception.

I hope that this post will resolve any questions or concerns anyone may have had regarding this issue.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Issue #1: <strong>Do these mods have private discussion channels with the admins?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>True!</strong></p>\n<p>It has been officially confirmed now that the admins and discord mods do indeed have a private chat room together. Apparently it's only for mod stuff, like how to structure the server and channels and roles and rules and such. Personally I still am uncomfortable with that as I think since Ruqqus isn't supposed to be a bureaucracy/dictatorship, these kinds of things should be public if there are any non-admin users involved, especially considering that the Discord server is an official affiliation to Ruqqus and there's currently no possible way to earn mod status there. There's also no guarantee that this chat will always remain limited to those topics, and other developments could take advantage of the un-transparent nature of this channel. It isn't a DefaultMods yet but it could easily become one. CrystalVulpine's law states that any organized not explicitly opposed to being controlled by a clique of the owners' friends will become controlled by one over time. We saw this on both Reddit and Digg. Thankfully, the admins have plans to combat this that are very similar to what I was already suggesting. The other thing is that the mods supposedly have access to the ban appeals channel (as stated in the welcome message), where people can appeal their bans from Ruqqus; if the admins intend on keeping that private, the mods definitely shouldn't be able to see that channel either as they aren't Ruqqus admins.</p>\n<p>Issue #2: <strong>Are the mods chosen because they're friends of the admins?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>False</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no actual process to become a mod as of yet, so <em>right now</em> no one who isn't a friend of the admins and can ask them about it casually is able to get modded. But that hasn't actually occurred yet, as the current mods were chosen in a moment of desperation, and people were asked to do it based on the suggestions of other users in the server, not just completely arbitrarily pre-selected by the admins. The good news is, the admins are planning on making it possible for anyone to become a mod, hopefully very soon. I'd be willing to offer some suggestions to the admins if need be, as I have moderated 40k+ subscribers on reddit in this way. The admins have the same experience, however they were in DefaultMods so they're probably used to the \"look for some of your friends to mod\" method of bringing new mods on, and may need some guidance on coming up with a new approach. I probably won't ask to be modded in the Discord as I barely use it, but I'll certainly help them set up a system that's as fair as possible. This also applies for any \"trusted user\" system the admins might implement in the future for Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>Issue #3: <strong>Is there currently no possible way for other users to become a mod no matter how constructive they are?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>Mostly True</strong></p>\n<p>As said in the previous explanation, the current mods were added based on users' suggestions during a period where it had to be done swiftly because the server was being overloaded. There is no actual way to begin as a mod right now, however the admins are planning on creating one in the future.</p>\n<p>Issue #4: <strong>Are the admins coordinating them to post PSAs in <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a> and officially answer questions?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>False</strong></p>\n<p>This one surprised me, because so many people were making those posts in the exact same format, including the discord mods. So it would make sense if the admins had a group of users making official announcements and answering questions. As it turns out though, someone just made a PSA post and everyone else copied it. I did this myself but I'm weird that way so I thought I was the exception. Apparently I'm not as weird as I thought.</p>\n<p>Issue #5: <strong>Were these mods chosen for other roles on Ruqqus?</strong>    \nStatus: <strong>Mostly false</strong></p>\n<p>There is no trusted user system yet, although I've heard there may be plans for one, but that will likely be after there's a real initiation process. The only exception was that 2 of them were made guildmasters of <a href=\"/+WatchRedditDie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+WatchRedditDie/pic/profile\"/>+WatchRedditDie</a> for completely unrelated reasons. However, if and when this feature does get added there will likely be a lot of overlap between trusted users and the Discord mods.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>So yeah, they still have a flawed system, but it's better than we thought it was. Either way there is nothing devious occurring, just a few oversights by the admins as well as actions taken in a hurry. All I'll say now is to make the discord mod discussion open to all users of the server, with no private chats for anyone but the admins (not mods), and to develop a real way for people to become mods before the current system causes any permanent damage to Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>About some of them also modding WRD: This alarmed me at first because the Discord struck me as a second instance of the admins picking favorites for assistant roles. The initial modding in WRD made sense since they were active in the guild and were also mods on WRD on reddit. But when they were also added on the Discord too it set off the cabal alarm that I have installed in my mind now (thanks to DefaultMods). What really happened was that they were suggested by the users of the Discord to be mods because they were active there too, so it was just a very odd coincidence. As for why other /r/WatchRedditDie mods were not invited to be guildmasters I can't say, although it could be that since none of the others have discord there was no way for the admins to ask if they could do it, as Ruqqus has no DMs.</p>\n", "comment_count": 14, "created_utc": 1594482156, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 4, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_12gx", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "12gx", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/12gx/psa-clearing-up-the-ruqqus-discord", "score": 12, "thumb_url": null, "title": "PSA: Clearing up the Ruqqus Discord moderation issue, with fact-checking and responses from the mods and admins.

As for why other /r/WatchRedditDie mods were not invited to be guildmasters I can't say, although it could be that since none of the others have discord there was no way for the admins to ask if they could do it, as Ruqqus has no DMs.</p>\n", "comment_count": 14, "created_utc": 1594482156, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 4, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_12gx", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "12gx", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/12gx/psa-clearing-up-the-ruqqus-discord", "score": 13, "thumb_url": null, "title": "PSA: Clearing up the Ruqqus Discord moderation issue, with fact-checking and responses from the mods and admins.
