Here's what I think about your two points:\n\nA. Yes, the mainstream media leans heavily left at the moment and that's obviously a problem for society in general. It entrenches leftist inclined people in their beliefs and it silences rightist people. But the solution isn't to create more rightist echo chambers in the style of the leftists, it's to create a place for discourse. Tucker does a good job of being a voice, but he does not create much of a discourse. He just entrenches rightists further into their ideology, which at least brings a bit of balance to the overall political scape of the West, but it doesn't really resolve any issues on a personal level. And it's on the personal level that people actually change their minds. Look at the absolute hellhole that Voat is. It's as bad or maybe even worse than Reddit. We can't become that.\n\nB. I bet people thought the same of Voat, but look how that ended up. We want leftist to come and argue. What leftist would go to Voat and think \"hey this seems like a place where I share my opinions\". Look at the front page. Almost every post is about race, especially about Jews. We need to remain a logical and open community that will allow any voice to be heard. No downvotes when faced with disagreement, and certainly no banning foreign or disliked opinions.\n\n>Second - Encourage contrarianism.\n\nA. I can't comment on this because I don't know enough about how downvotes work on Ruqqus. On Reddit downvotes would result in you being prevented from commenting again for a certain amount of time. This meant that if you were voicing a controversial opinion and you got a lot of attention for it, you were prevented from actually defending your points. This was especially difficult when multiple people would argue against you, as you could only really respond to one of them. I've been in this situation. You end up having to give up because you are put on a silence timer, which effectively in your opponents' minds means you've given up on defending your idea because it must be indefensible. I'd be more inclined to say we remove downvotes altogether, but I'd like to understand more about how downvotes work. Please let me know.\n\nB. This is an interesting idea but wouldn't that remove the practicality of votes? All it would show is the site's or the guild's general opinion on what's been said. Is there any use to that? On Reddit it would move downvoted comments to the bottom, removing them from most people's view. This theoretically would be a good thing if people actually used votes as they were originally intended, which was to hide comments that didn't contribute to a discussion. Obviously, they ended up becoming opinion monitors and a suppression mechanism, so they did more harm than good. I'm not opposed to your suggestion here, I just am not sure if there's a point.\n\nC. Yes, but from any source, not just Reddit alternatives. Really this is just us reiterating our opposing points. You want only from rightist places, I want from everywhere. Oh, and by the way, I do see the utility in Ruqqus being mostly rightist at the start, simply because the right is more inclined to support absolute free speech. But it shouldn't stay that way, ideally. And even now it should definitely not be an overwhelming majority.\n\nI'll end on a similar note to you. We need Voaters. But we also need Redditors. And, most importantly, we need our own unique and different community.

Ruqqus is an aesthetically pleasing, thoughtfully designed platform with aims that appeal inherently to conservatives.

Because we don't. About half of the US leans right and this market is woefully underserved by social media. Meanwhile if you are a leftist you currently have Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Snapchat, Amazon, CBS, MSNBC, NYT, Youtube, etc, etc, etc, across the entire social media, mass media and legacy media landscape fighting for your attention. Appealing to conservatives will get us a lot farther.\r\n\r\nProof? **Tucker Carlson**. There's exactly one meaningful conservative voice on television today, and he's the **highest rated cable news show host in history**. His 8 o'clock monologues do obscene ratings just on TV, without counting their reach going viral on Youtube and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nB. Because leftists will come anyway. Ruqqus is an aesthetically pleasing, thoughtfully designed platform with aims that appeal inherently to conservatives. Leftists will **hate** that, and they will come in droves to **tell us** that they hate it, and the more we work to appeal to conservatives, the more leftists will show up to complain - while telling us how we need to change the site and community to appeal to them and not icky conservatives who are the core of your audience and brand appeal.\r\n\r\nRemember - **Get woke, go broke.** How do you think that happens? Leftists love to infest organizations, tell you all the ways you need to change to please them, and then abandon you after you do. **Be brave, get paid.**\r\n\r\nSecond - Encourage contrarianism.\r\n\r\nThe number one thing that will poison this site's aspirations towards being something better than what we left behind is the inherent tendency of sites with point-based opinion aggregation to homogenize and have mass opinion turn against minority opinion. Start working against that today. \r\n\r\nA. **Remove the downvote cap.** People should be allowed to get all the downvotes they want.\r\n\r\nB. **Show upvotes and downvotes**. Don't hide people's support from them and make them feel like they're alone. Don't hide people's support from **yourselves, looking at your own site**, and trick ourselves into thinking the side with fewer people is the side with no people. There's a reason that **real elections** tally all the votes, and this is it. Learn from standing practice and tradition - another great way to show we're thinking along conservative lines.\r\n\r\nC. Encourage people to come here from reddit alternatives - **legally**.\r\n\r\nI'm going to borrow a line from Trump here and I'm also just going to leap out and say it - we need Voaters. We all have years of conditioning telling us that they're the Devil, but since the people who told us that are Reddit and Twitter, and now we're out here in the wide open seas that Voat's been out on for, what, half a decade or more, maybe it's time to have a little [sympathy for the Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgnClrx8N2k), Maybe they have a perspective on speech we don't, since they've been out here practicing it while we were trapped in the Reddit bubble.\r\n\r\nMaybe their admin and maybe their users aren't out to get us - maybe they're real people who really believe the things they say. And since they've managed to survive as long as they have despite their monstrous reputation - maybe they can give us some tips on how to survive when people **inevitably** call us monsters too. If they break actual rules like making calls to violence or posting loli/CP or whatever else that goes against the TOS, chuck 'em.
