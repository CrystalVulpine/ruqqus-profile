This is a great segway into my next point.\r\n\r\nAs you\u2019re all likely aware, the last change to Reddit\u2019s content policy involved adding strict hate speech rules.

This could happen by the end of 2021 instead of say 2024 like I previously predicted. The site is going down FAST. \r\n\r\nMy final point is about the state of this daily news post. I have decided to unsub from all political subs and guilds, reset my YouTube history, and not go on Twitter because the stress of the horrible political climate is bearing down on me, and that will likely have an impact on this news post.\r\n\r\nYou have to understand that I\u2019m not an adult and I\u2019m too young to vote in this election, I turn 17 on August 8. So my voice doesn\u2019t matter anyways and even if it did, I live in Massachusetts where it still doesn\u2019t matter, and even if it did in my state I can\u2019t talk much about it online. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling extremely overwhelmed and increasingly angry and upset. Some reasons why include how the mainstream media ignores the atrocities happening in China and Hong Kong, the unarmed black teenagers my age murdered in the autonomous zone, Jessica Whitaker\u2019s murder, and the constant censorship of conservatives and libertarians online. I\u2019m sick of this shit and I\u2019m not coming back to anything political until at least November 4 when the election is over.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of my state, Massachusetts is one of the only states not in a COVID spike, so we have a better chance than most to go back to school (being a deep blue state hurts us). My first day of school is August 26 and I want to be detoxed of political bullshit by then, as I feel that my views won\u2019t be popular in school and I always have kept politics out of my personal life. I want to have 6 weeks to heal, so by the end of the day Tuesday, no more politics for me.\r\n\r\nThis impacts this news post because a lot of my content is from political subs so it\u2019ll be harder to find it. The only subs I\u2019ve decided to keep that are related to politics so far are PCM, worldpolitics, and some of the anti-censorship subs. So if you find any post I might find important, just link it to the previous day\u2019s post.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that I might post more infrequently going forward, like once every few days or every week, because there has been a decline in quality I\u2019ve noticed. I was planning on announcing this on Friday but the second wave prevented that from needing to happen.

We still need to reach out more about Reddit\u2019s hatred of literally anyone who\u2019s not a trans Chinese communist.\r\n\r\nAHS of course wasn\u2019t happy with this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/hprrfk/people_at_rbanfemalehatesubs_share_terf_article/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nu/IBiteYou also made a very sobering post to r/conservatives about the horrible treatment of right wingers on the platform today: https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/hq0im1/this_post_has_been_a_long_time_coming_but_it_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nThis is very blackpilling if you wanna call it that. This comes out as a plea but honestly many conservative subs should really inform their users about what\u2019s to come, because Reddit is currently in a steep decline and it will only get steeper. This is a great segway into my next point.\r\n\r\nAs you\u2019re all likely aware, the last change to Reddit\u2019s content policy involved adding strict hate speech rules. I predict that the next content policy change will target \u201cmisinformation\u201d, and that it will be the lynchpin in causing the next ban wave. Which I predict to be in late August to late October, likely on the later side if the content policy changes.\r\n\r\nUpon first thinking about this, you probably thought that some subs like r/LockdownSkepticism and r/Wuhan_Flu are immediate goners, and you\u2019d be right, but they won\u2019t stop there. Reddit will use this excuse to ban opinions contrary to the narrative. In other words, say bye to most if not all of the conservative subs and possibly some centrist subs. Yes, this could be the end of r/conservative, r/conspiracy, and possibly even r/Republican or even r/centrist.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s possible that that the ENTIRE list of mine will be banned LONG before I thought it would happen. This could happen by the end of 2021 instead of say 2024 like I previously predicted. The site is going down FAST. \r\n\r\nMy final point is about the state of this daily news post. I have decided to unsub from all political subs and guilds, reset my YouTube history, and not go on Twitter because the stress of the horrible political climate is bearing down on me, and that will likely have an impact on this news post.\r\n\r\nYou have to understand that I\u2019m not an adult and I\u2019m too young to vote in this election, I turn 17 on August 8. So my voice doesn\u2019t matter anyways and even if it did, I live in Massachusetts where it still doesn\u2019t matter, and even if it did in my state I can\u2019t talk much about it online. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling extremely overwhelmed and increasingly angry and upset. Some reasons why include how the mainstream media ignores the atrocities happening in China and Hong Kong, the unarmed black teenagers my age murdered in the autonomous zone, Jessica Whitaker\u2019s murder, and the constant censorship of conservatives and libertarians online. I\u2019m sick of this shit and I\u2019m not coming back to anything political until at least November 4 when the election is over.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of my state, Massachusetts is one of the only states not in a COVID spike, so we have a better chance than most to go back to school (being a deep blue state hurts us). My first day of school is August 26 and I want to be detoxed of political bullshit by then, as I feel that my views won\u2019t be popular in school and I always have kept politics out of my personal life. I want to have 6 weeks to heal, so by the end of the day Tuesday, no more politics for me.\r\n\r\nThis impacts this news post because a lot of my content is from political subs so it\u2019ll be harder to find it. The only subs I\u2019ve decided to keep that are related to politics so far are PCM, worldpolitics, and some of the anti-censorship subs. So if you find any post I might find important, just link it to the previous day\u2019s post.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that I might post more infrequently going forward, like once every few days or every week, because there has been a decline in quality I\u2019ve noticed. I was planning on announcing this on Friday but the second wave prevented that from needing to happen. However, assume that a post will be coming tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAs always watch out on Discord, and probably catch you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHere is the list for today:\r\n\r\nVery High:\r\n\r\nr/ConsumeProduct*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor*\r\n\r\nr/ClericalFascism*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/smuggies*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers*\r\n\r\nr/DebateAltRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLawEnforcement*\u2020 -BANNED 6/30/20\r\n\r\nr/Shortcells*\u2020 -BANNED 6/26/20\r\n\r\nr/BruhFunny*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/ShitNeoconsSay*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BrapBarn*\u2020 -BANNED 6/8/20\r\n\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\nr/soyboys*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/imgoingtohellforthis2*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AltRightChristian*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad*\r\n\r\nr/The_Cabal*\r\n\r\nr/subredditcancer* -CLOSED 2/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeuxRAMA*\u2020 -BANNED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/Thank_China* -RESTRICTED 5/13/20\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever* -RESTRICTED 5/9/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLandlords*\r\n\r\nr/Chodi*\r\n\r\nr/TheHonkPill*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LockdownSkepticism*\r\n\r\nr/Plandemic*\r\n\r\nr/topnotchshitposting*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/cleanlivingkings*\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/Wuhan_Flu*\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/The_Congress* -CLOSED 6/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit* -PRIVATED 7/6/20\r\n\r\nr/DrainTheSwamp*\r\n\r\nr/itsafetish*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW*\r\n\r\nr/AdminCrickets*\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AgainstSubredditBans*\r\n\r\nr/ITears*\r\n\r\nr/yiffinhell*\u2020 -RUINED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/redditownsreddit*\r\n\r\nr/TheNewRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AZNIdentity*\r\n\r\nr/PresidentialRaceMemes*\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n\r\nr/TheRedPill\r\n\r\nr/IncelsWithoutHate*\r\n\r\nr/DarkHumorAndMemes*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeclineIntoCensorship*\r\n\r\nr/MLBStreams*\r\n\r\nr/eyeblech*\r\n\r\nr/badunitedkingdom\r\n\r\nr/FemaleDatingStrategy\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/TruFemcels* -PRIVATED 6/28/20\r\n\r\nr/FULLCOMMUNISM\r\n\r\nr/HiddenChangelog*\r\n\r\nr/MurderedByAdmins*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW2*\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi*\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/thomasjefferson* -CLOSED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/Drama\r\n\r\nr/redditmoment\r\n\r\nr/Terfisaslur\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/undelete\r\n\r\nr/NoLockedThreads\r\n\r\nr/HiddenPolicy*\r\n\r\nr/WorstOfModeration*\r\n\r\nr/ModsBeingDicks*\r\n\r\nr/RedditCensors*\r\n\r\nr/TrueLesbians\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/China_Flu\r\n\r\nNot in danger, for now, however, some of these subs may not see 2021, these subs all have less than a 10% chance of being banned in this wave:\r\n\r\nr/SocialJusticeInAction\r\n\r\nr/WikipediaInAction\r\n\r\nr/TumblrInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction2\r\n\r\nr/CringeTopia\r\n\r\nr/NoahGetTheBoat\r\n\r\nr/Shuffles_Deck\r\n\r\nr/FreeSpeech\r\n\r\nr/BestOfLiveLeak\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/MoreTankieChapo\u2020 -BANNED 7/10/20\r\n\r\nr/banned\r\n\r\nr/worldpolitics\r\n\r\nr/EverythingFoxes -CLOSED 6/2/20\r\n\r\nr/awwaf -CLOSED 4/20/20\r\n\r\nr/conspiracy\r\n\r\nr/Conservative\r\n\r\nr/ShitPoliticsSays\r\n\r\nr/anarcho_capitalism\r\n\r\nr/4chan\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyretard\r\n\r\nr/metacanada\r\n\r\nr/MensRights\r\n\r\nr/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\r\n\r\nr/PussyPassDenied\r\n\r\nr/PussyPass\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WGTOW\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalHorrorStory\r\n\r\nr/Trump\r\n\r\nr/Walkaway\r\n\r\nr/WhiteBeauty\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BeatMeatToIt\r\n\r\nr/AgainstKarmaWhores\r\n\r\nr/PewdiepieSubmissions\r\n\r\nr/EnoughCommieSpam\r\n\r\nr/Enough_AOC_Spam\r\n\r\nr/drumpfisfinished\r\n\r\nr/FreeKarma4U\r\n\r\nr/GodWeeps\r\n\r\nSubs that won\u2019t get banned because they are useful to the admins:\r\n\r\nr/AgainstDegenerateSubs\r\n\r\nr/reclassified\r\n\r\nr/ShadowBan\r\n\r\nr/CommentRemovalChecker -RESTRICTED TO A BOT, RUNS SYNDICATED TO R/SHADOWBAN\r\n\r\nr/RedditAlternatives\r\n\r\n\u2020 = Banned (RIP)\r\n\r\nAsterisk = >50% chance of being banned by Election Day", "body_html": "<p>Ruqqus only.</p>\n<p>Some important topics are on the table today.</p>\n<p>First of all, the TERFs have made enough noise to get articles posted about their plight.
