But now the situation is arguably even worse than before, because now the few non-admins who were modded then have a lot of control over the server, but the admins still refuse to add anyone else as a mod or discuss plans and changes for the server with anyone except those mods, meaning &lt; 10 users have input and everyone else probably doesn't even know about what the plans are. Those mods have tried to get the admins to add other mods who showed an interest in it but they've consistently refused. The admins also claimed that they were going to make it possible to become a mod, but it's taken them way too long so I'm convinced that it's not happening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I complain about this way too much and if you want to find out more just look at my post and comment history and you'll find more than enough information about this.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594676959, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_3i3d", "guild_id": "2", "herald_guild": null, "id": "3i3d", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent_comment_id": ["3hwv"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/15hg/sargon-army/3i3d", "post_id": "15hg", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["3i3d"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/15hg/sargon-army/3i7r", "post": {"author_name": null, "award_count": 0, "body": "So who here just joined from Sargon of Akkad's stream when dono's kept mentioning Ruqqus?", "body_html": "<p>So who here just joined from Sargon of Akkad's stream when dono's kept mentioning Ruqqus?</p>\n", "comment_count": 17, "created_utc": 1594668993, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 5, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_15hg", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "15hg", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/15hg/sargon-army", "score": 19, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Sargon Army", "upvotes": 20, "url": ""}, "post_id": "15hg", "score": 2, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
