I've posted apolitical things that get more positive comments than upvotes. On edditr with millions of users, it doesn't matter. Here, it does. Don't look at a photo and think \"How nice!\" without upvoting.\n\n### Stop \"free-riding\" \ud83d\uded1 \u270d\ufe0f\nWhen things get big, they tend to follow the Pareto rule (20% of people do 80% of whatever the thing in question). In the case of small things (like, startups) everyone has to be way more active. For every session you browse Ruqqus, make sure to make at least one post.\n\n### Forget Niches (for now) \ud83c\udf1f\n+Music is barely at critical mass. Why focus on building +JustinBiebler or whatever until there are more users?\n\n### Recycle \u267b\ufe0f\nNot every post is going to be original.

I've posted apolitical things that get more positive comments than upvotes. On edditr with millions of users, it doesn't matter. Here, it does. Don't look at a photo and think \"How nice!\" without upvoting.</p>\n<h3>Stop \"free-riding\" \ud83d\uded1 \u270d\ufe0f</h3>\n<p>When things get big, they tend to follow the Pareto rule (20% of people do 80% of whatever the thing in question). In the case of small things (like, startups) everyone has to be way more active.

For every session you browse Ruqqus, make sure to make at least one post.\n\n### Forget Niches (for now) \ud83c\udf1f\n+Music is barely at critical mass. Why focus on building +JustinBiebler or whatever until there are more users?\n\n### Recycle \u267b\ufe0f\nNot every post is going to be original. If you use other aggregators, there's nothing wrong with a few reposts. If you remember something cool you found 10 years okay, feel free to share it. Not everyone will have seen it.\n\n### Use +Guilds \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\nIf you've made a guild, made a few posts, and figured out what you want to do with it, then post it to +Guilds. If you don't make Guilds, join +Guilds to see new guilds.\n\n---\n\nAnother great tip in my opinion would be to sort the mainpage and your various guilds by *NEW* `?sort=new`", "body_html": "<p>Yes, more voting! \u2611\ufe0f</p>\n<p>Here are some more great tips mentioned on the <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/post/14ee/a-categorized-list-of-apolitical-guilds\">Categorized List of Apolitical Guilds</a> post:</p>\n<h3>Upvote Things \ud83d\udc4d</h3>\n<p>If you see something cool, <em><strong>upvote it</strong></em>.
