The work began 9 days after the inauguration of the Ponte del Littorio by the Duce and was ready in 542 days.

Mussolini said: \"I want it to be just as hard on the mobsters as it has been on my Bolognese squads.\" \"State authority must be absolutely, I repeat absolutely, re-established in Sicily. If the laws currently in force obstruct it, it will not be a problem. We will make new laws. \" Even if the mafia was not completely liquidated, it fell so to speak \"to sleep\".

In 1927 Fascism passed a law for the construction of a \"Idroscalo\" for the city of Milan. Real sea, even salty, sandy shore, marine pines, bathers, lifeguards. The \"Idroscalo\" is a large gully 3 km long and 300 meters wide with 300 head for aircraft maneuvers. The basin occupies an area of \u200b\u200b610,000 square meters. It is fed by spring waters. The Idroscalo has always been- to reported as quagmire. The Duce has transformed it into a basin, a lake, a \"slice\" of sea with all marine characteristics. This spectacular miracle was inaugurated in 1930. The beach has 100 cabins, has its \"promenade\", with trees around it, hotels, amusement parks, sports fields, meadows. At the center of the basin there is an island that can be easily reached by boat and find all the fun there.\nPalazzo della Previdenza Sociale in each provincial capital</li>\n<li>1930 Verona: General warehouses with cutting-edge refrigeration systems in Europe\nRome: Viale della Conciliazione\nRome: Metro\nRome: Stadio dei Marmi (in front of the huge obelisk with the inscription \"Mussolini Dux\")\nRome: University city inaugurated in 1935\nRome: Palazzo della Farnesina, seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nRome: foundation of Cinecitt\u00e0 (works started in 1936, finished in 1937)</li>\n<li>1931/4 Venice. In 657 days the bridge of the Littorio (today of Liberty) was built, which connects Venice to the mainland. And since towards the end the engineer Eugenio Miozzi realized he had spent less than he spent they had given him, he decided to use the surplus to build, in front of the railway station, a new bridge that would cross the Grand Canal, the Scalzi bridge (built in Istrian stone, without any armor). The work began 9 days after the inauguration of the Ponte del Littorio by the Duce and was ready in 542 days. And since towards the end of this second work he realized that he had spent less than expected, he decided to demolish the old iron bridge of the Academy (in pitiful conditions) to replace it with a temporary wooden one. Felling, debris removal, construction of the new building and inauguration: one month. And the beautiful wooden bridge is still there. Creation of the car terminal in Piazzale Roma (1931-1933). Construction of the garage of Sant'Andrea, one of the major works of rationalist architecture in Venice (1931-1934).
