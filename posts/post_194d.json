The admins get real snarky about it and refuse to change their approach, and everyone else either doesn't care, immediately discredits me as a \"conspiracy theorist\" for documenting facts, or even supports the ring of mods for the admins. The admins usually play nice with the mods unlike everyone else, but they still ignore them about this concern and refuse to let any \"outsiders\" in. They were pretty much forced to add the current mods because it was too much for 3 people, but once you do that it has to be possible for everyone to do or else it <em>will</em> be a cabal.</p>\n","created_utc":1594915972,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_3w6k","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/betafeedback/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1590331898,"description":"This used to be a place to share, view, and track feedback for Ruqqus.
