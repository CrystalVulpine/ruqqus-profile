And the same goes for everyone else. The loudest can't be in charge of what you see, and in fact you could ban every last one of them if you wanted. People aren't angels, and that's exactly why they can't be trusted to rule like this, whether it's by a few dictators (as in this case) or collectively (democracy/mob rule).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I covered it in this thread, but I also mentioned being able to add other users' mod actions to you, both sitewide and at the guild level. For example, if someone thinks I'm good at moderating +foxes, they can choose for my moderation there to apply to them as well. It just should shouldn't be forced.\r\n\r\n> There is a reason there are hosts for parties, MC’s for events, permits and heads of committees even for fun events.\r\n\r\nYes, because reality is objective and personalizing it is mostly impossible.
