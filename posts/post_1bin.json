We institute taxes and human rights and all the rest because **it benefits us and is the lesser evil compared to complete anarchy**. The concept of rights is a **useful fabrication**. What Crazy libertarians tend to do is treat these man-made inherently-compromising laws that protect \"rights\" and treat them as if they are the real laws of nature. Unrealistic clashes with reality-as-it-is despite utopian thinking will inevitably cause suffering. Both Communists and AnCaps will always fail at their utopias because they deny reality and human nature. Civilization will always be a compromise between pragmatics and ideals.
