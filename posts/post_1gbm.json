He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe....

If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is an example: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe....

As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do.

(Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is an example: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe....

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video.

He also started boasting about how big he would be.

An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

Of course I saw it in the \"suggested videos\" sidebar. The majority of the stuff was stupid mods, and it seemed like a decent channel, although the 1M+ subscribers surprised me a little.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.

And behold, the video from this December really *was* the first video, at which point the channel had just hit 1k subscribers! No wonder I hadn't seen them before. But now I was really confused, as all the popular channels I've ever watched took an insanely long amount of time to build up their fanbase, with lots of videos in the process. Most popular channels took over a year to get the first 10k subs, and had average beginnings, but this guy just got hundreds of thousands of subs out of nowhere, reaching 1M in 6 months with only 34 videos, and their first videos were insanely high quality for a beginner *and* they and all the videos up till now got 1-5 million views every single time, all without any major SEO (search engine optimization) techniques! For comparison, the most popular channels usually get about 1-400k views per video. He literally has a 100% virality rate, as a *beginner*, which didn't sit right with me.\r\n\r\n[1k subscribers in December, then another 1k+ the next day](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1212051427079667720)\r\n\r\n[1 million views on his first few videos in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1216193854816313344)\r\n\r\n[50k subs in January](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1221755156087353345)\r\n\r\n[100k in March](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1240043074639876097)\r\n\r\n[200k in April](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1255536659707412483)\r\n\r\n[270k a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1261283315417518081)\r\n\r\nAfter that it's literally about 100k per week\r\n\r\n[400k a month later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1274152818891526147)\r\n\r\n[700k 2 weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1277599336784891904)\r\n\r\n[1 million a few weeks later](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1284901504281968641)\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing the twitter revealed is that his Twitch were created at the exact same time he started posting those videos, and he *did* have videos from before December but they were all removed immediately before the boom in popularity. He also started boasting about how big he would be. One of his first tweets was about quitting his job because he was \"set for life\" (implying he'd be making a fortune from YT) but it seems to have been deleted in the past few days. Keep in mind this was back in December, so it implies he knew this would happen ahead of time.\r\n\r\n[Proof of older videos that were removed](https://twitter.com/FundyLive/status/1178008635223339008)\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the statistics of his *super legitimate* growth over the past few months: https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw\r\n\r\nThis seemed strange to me, even though I'm not on YT, so I went on reddit and asked a few experienced and popular YouTubers what could be happening here.\r\n\r\nI got an answer that Fundy could be an \"industry plant\". An industry plant usually refers to a musician, but after looking into this it's apparently a complaint among YouTubers as well. What YT will do is take someone random with a small following, and set them up with all the right equipment, ideas, format, etc. Then when they start posting those videos, YT makes sure they're all over the suggested videos section so everyone watches them and they make a ton of money off of them. As a side effect, that person receives major popularity extremely fast. Of course YT denies it, but they all do. Probably the most famous example of this is the [\"living in a van\" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg).\r\n\r\nThis would make perfect sense here, and explain all the strange aspects of the channel that coincided with its unnaturally high growth. Getting millions of views on their first videos out of nowhere, and then having that continue to happen every single time, and getting a bunch of subscriptions out of nowhere are the main signs of this, especially if it's coming from places like the video suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's the exact response from a YouTuber with 300k+ subscriptions:\r\n\r\n> Likely an industry plant. (Yes, YouTube has industry plants..... several actually)\r\n\r\n> An industry plant is typically in reference to a musician. A label will basically take somebody random or with a very small following and invest a lot of money into them. Giving them a ton of capital for music videos, production, etc. The label then makes money off of them and the musician typically receives a large following fast.\r\n\r\n> YouTube does the same thing, but tries to deny it (they all do). They will find somebody and set them up with the required equipment and such. Then they will purposely throw their videos into everyone's recommended section, making the content creator blow up in popularity and resulting in YouTube making a ton of money off of them. If you ever see a channel where someone is brand new yet has INSANE quality and their first video garners 1,000,000+ views and they magically have 500,000+ subscribers and continue to get 1,000,000-5,000,000 views per video it is likely that they are industry plant.\r\n\r\n> Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg\r\n\r\n> She \"lives in a van\" yet has extremely high quality videos, a great camera, editing software, etc... Has relatively garbage SEO tactics yet I believe she got over 1,000,000 subscribers in her first month ever on YouTube. She is an industry plant and people quickly caught on. She began deleting comments making those claims and never addressed it I believe.... It's a scummy practice and entirely unfair, but YouTube and other media companies do this as a quick and easy way to make a lot of money while simultaneously giving someone an advantage at their career above other people who are actually putting in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think this is what's going on here? Is Fundy an industry plant?\r\n\r\nImo, \"Industry plant\" or not, I don't see any way this is legit.\r\n\r\n(And of course the first thing I see on this guild when going to post this is about the Ruqqus Minecraft server now using Fundy's Impossible Difficulty plugin.)", "body_html": "<p>Sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of explanation and data to be understood.</p>\n<p>This all started two days ago when I found a new Minecraft YouTuber called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/fundy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fundy</a>\" while watching other stuff like AntVenom.
