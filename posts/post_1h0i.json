Does God want that? No? But in order for God to allow free will, he has to allow people to break the rules, and reap the consequences of their rule-breaking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If he didn't want that, then why did he make Eve and the Snake? He knew what they were going to do and he then chose to make them.  SHOCK AND GASP! They did what he knew they were already going to do.   Why did he do that if he didn't' want that to happen?</p>\n<p>...And it's not a contingency plan. Contingencies are for when things don't go according to plan. He KNOWS what's going to happen. It's not a contingency, it's Plan A. This is what he wanted all along because if he's omnipotent he knew all this was going to happen. EVEN with some sort of later plan to \"fix it\".... that's thousands of years of suffering for all humanity before Jesus comes about and get nailed for rabble rousing.   And then you have the gap in time between word of Jesus reaches India and China, where MOST OF HUMANITY lives. In the meantime, everyone is just burning and suffering eternal because they just weren't told yet.  Super.</p>\n<p>This is why omnipotency really complicates things.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1595928663, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_5743", "guild_id": "25t", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5743", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 31, "parent_comment_id": ["5739"], "permalink": "/+ReligiousDebate/post/1h0i/atheistsagnostics-of-ruqqus-what-pushes-you/5743", "post_id": "1h0i", "score": 1, "upvotes": 4, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["5743"], "permalink": "/+ReligiousDebate/post/1h0i/atheistsagnostics-of-ruqqus-what-pushes-you/576n", "post": {"author_name": "christianmusicreleases", "award_count": 0, "body": "Just curious.", "body_html": "<p>Just curious.</p>\n", "comment_count": 111, "created_utc": 1595479187, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_1h0i", "guild_id": "25t", "guild_name": "ReligiousDebate", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1h0i", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+ReligiousDebate/post/1h0i/atheistsagnostics-of-ruqqus-what-pushes-you", "score": 3, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Atheists/Agnostics of Ruqqus, what pushes you away from a belief in God?", "upvotes": 4, "url": ""}, "post_id": "1h0i", "score": -2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
