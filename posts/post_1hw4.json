With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn’t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI’m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?","body_html":"<p>This is only prediction and I’ll likely be wildly off.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in.

This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here.

Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn’t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI’m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?","body_html":"<p>This is only prediction and I’ll likely be wildly off.

Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close.

Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber.

Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.</p>\n<p>Late July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.</p>\n<p>August 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.</p>\n<p>August 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives.

They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content.

The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out.

Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more.

Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves.

Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.</p>\n<p>2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.</p>\n<p>2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.</p>\n<p>2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.</p>\n<p>2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here.

This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn’t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI’m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?","body_html":"<p>This is only prediction and I’ll likely be wildly off.

Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden.

All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined.

Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn’t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI’m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?","body_html":"<p>This is only prediction and I’ll likely be wildly off.

Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber.

Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset. Reddit’s rankings begin to rapidly decline, but the admins do nothing to fix it.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 2020: Depending on how the election goes, this is where paths split but I’ll go based off of the middle.\r\n\r\nNovember/December 2020: Reddit falls below the top 25 websites.\r\n\r\nDecember 2020: A small ban wave hits and takes out a few big subs, such as PPD, r/ShitPoliticsSays, r/redditmoment, r/drumpfisfinished, and r/cringetopia.\r\n\r\nJanuary-April 2021: By this point the cabal is easy to see and it’s existence becomes know among most Redditors. The admins begin publicly taking marching orders from AHS and TMOR, and subs they want to go are noted to be axed either immediately or in the next ban wave. This includes even fairly innocent subs. The annual March ban wave takes out a some more right wing and meme subs, and this time all the free karma subs are also axed. Another change is that the subreddit ban evasion filter is once again strengthened. About a third of the subs banned based off of this are false positives. They aren’t restored. The exodus grows, Reddit begins to lose many more users than they take in. Reddit falls below the top 30 websites.\r\n\r\nMay-August 2021: Around this time, new subreddit creation is restricted to a select group of users and all small subs that have any wrongthink are wiped. Bigger subs are spared for the moment, but a June ban wave takes some of them out. Centrist subs begin to be impacted. r/JustUnsubbed, r/TrueOffMyChest, r/unpopularopinion, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts are likely banned here. Reddit falls below the top 40 websites.\r\n\r\nSeptember-December 2021: There are two ban waves in this time in September and December. Around now there is likely a content policy change that once again tightens the rules on speech. Right wing views aren’t explicitly banned yet but it’s getting close. Centrists are also beginning to be heavily censored. People begin to leave more and more. Reddit falls below the top 50 websites.\r\n\r\n2022: Early on in the year, right wingers are pretty much banned from the site. Power mod alternative subs are all banned or quarantined, and the quarantined ones are soon promptly banned. In the middle of the year, Reddit’s updates its content policy and completely bans pornography and nearly all other NSFW content. Reddit alternatives such as this site begin to seriously take off and Reddit has serious competition, but it’s far too late at this point. Later on in the year, Reddit begins to consolidate all subs, and ban small communities. Nearly all remaining subs are moderated by power mods. Almost all right wing voices are gone, some long gone. Reddit falls below the top 100 websites, and possibly below one of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2023: Reddit shuts down all communities aside from their defaults, and bans all NSFW content, and the turmoil on the site begins to seriously increase, with even the left wing loonies on the site knowing something is horribly wrong. But this is shut down by the admins quickly. Almost all centrist voices are gone, some long gone, and even neoliberals begin to leave in droves. Reddit falls below the top 250 websites, including one or more of its alternatives.\r\n\r\n2024: Reddit is a wasteland of what it once was, and as the election season hits, it’s influence is no longer as big as it is this cycle. This leads to people hating both candidates for being “chuds” (unless one is a socialist of course, then they’ll stan him/her/whatever fucking gender). Most neoliberals leave. Reddit falls below the top 500 websites.\r\n\r\n2025: Reddit no longer brings in any profit and is a solely socialist echo chamber. Reddit falls below the top 1000 websites.\r\n\r\n2026: By this point, Reddit doesn’t continue to fall as much as it did, and instead remains a small socialist forum.\r\n\r\nI’m probably being extremely pessimistic (or optimistic depending on how you look at it), but do you honestly see Reddit as being any different in 2026 than I do here?","body_html":"<p>This is only prediction and I’ll likely be wildly off.

With the new hate speech policy, Reddit’s decline has entered an absolute nosedive from a relatively slow burn. Here’s a prediction about what’s to come. Note that if Trump wins the decline will continue steeply, if Biden wins the decline will slow.\r\n\r\nLate July 2020: A third smaller wave of bans hits Reddit, some notable casualties are r/Chodi and r/PinkPillFeminism.\r\n\r\nAugust 2020: As the coronavirus pandemic continues and progress towards a vaccine happens as the election season continues, Reddit begins to wish for a way to “control the narrative” and works with other social media sites to coordinate this, just like what happened in June. Their plan is to add in a true misinformation policy. Upfront, this will target the alternative coronavirus subs such as r/LockdownSkepticism, r/Plandemic, r/Wuhan_Flu, and r/China_Flu, but in actuality, this will also take out some of the smaller conservative subs AND communist subs in an attempt to control the election narrative and take Republican and Green Party voters and give them to Biden. This could also take out WRD and all the anti-censorship subs (as they probably can’t get them for hate speech anymore) They choose the last Monday of the month to roll out this policy as appears to be tradition.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 2020: Reddit rolls out it’s new expanded misinformation policy. All alternative coronavirus subreddits are banned. A noticeable chunk of conservative and communist subreddits are banned. r/Conspiracy is possibly banned. Some conservative subs are quarantined. r/Conservative probably stays but not without new mods infiltrating the team like T_D. Conservative.win becomes a necessity. Reddit’s allowed political spectrum thins from the far left (antifa is alt left but it’s an exception) to conservatives, down to moderate communists to moderate conservatives. This brings a notable exodus to alternatives, likely 4chan, Ruqqus, Saidit, and possibly iFunny.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2020: Reddit begins actioning accounts more severely than right now for discussing conspiracies (truths) related to Reddit including admin vote manipulated propaganda, the 93 of the top 500 subs are controlled by 5 people thing, the AHS CP scandal, and the u/Maxwellhill scandal. They also up their liberal propaganda bot operation.\r\n\r\nLate September 2020: In honor of Reddit’s annual September ban wave, a small one happens here. Some possible casualties include r/averageredditor, r/SargonOfAkkad, r/AZNIdentity, r/LoveForLandlords, r/cleanlivingkings, r/IncelsWithoutHate, r/tucker_carlson, and KiA2.\r\n\r\nEarly October 2020: By now nearly every popular sub is infiltrated with socialist and neoliberal propaganda and is extremely toxic. Mods who don’t want to comply are promptly axed and replaced by power mods who are more willing to comply. People become sick of this and the already ongoing exodus continues.\r\n\r\nMid October 2020: Joking about topics such as Joe Biden being a pedophile lead to some account suspensions for harassment and bullying. Can’t criticize Biden. This begins a discussion about the next content policy change, which the admins want to roll out the last Monday of October.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2020: Reddit updates the content policy regarding bullying. They tighten the existing harassment and hate speech policies, and add another pillar that covers bullying. This takes out many shitposting subs, edgy meme subs, incel subs, TERF subs, and conservative subs. Some of these topics are completely wiped off the site. This likely means the end of many of these subs: PCM, WRD, MGTOW, FDS, TRP, r/4chan, r/Drama, KiA, and TiA. Subs like OKBR, r/Trump, r/anarcho_capitalism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts, and maybe even r/MensRights or r/ihaveihaveihavereddit are quarantined. This causes a massive exodus away from Reddit, and even casual users begin to get upset.
