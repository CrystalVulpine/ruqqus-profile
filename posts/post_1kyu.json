The relentless politicisation of every subreddit really killed the site for me. If it's not about politics, it's been upvoted because the subject is a girl, is black, or is wearing a mask. Most of the actual content is trash which people only upvote for the sake of virtue signalling, it's like a parody. Circlejerking was always a problem on Reddit, and likely will be on Ruqqus too, but the abusive moderation and admin intervention which suppresses anyone who steps out of line really has done a number on Reddit.</p>\n","created_utc":1595784522,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_4zf4","guild_id":"1v","herald_guild":null,"id":"4zf4","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/1kyu/do-you-still-use-reddit-alongside/4zf4","post_id":"1kyu","score":8,"upvotes":8,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["4zf4"],"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/1kyu/do-you-still-use-reddit-alongside/55bn","post":{"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"I use both websites, but I try to visit and spend more time on Ruqqus","body_html":"<p>I use both websites, but I try to visit and spend more time on Ruqqus</p>\n","comment_count":46,"created_utc":1595782703,"domain":"text post","downvotes":2,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_1kyu","guild_id":"1v","guild_name":"AskRuqqus","herald_guild":null,"id":"1kyu","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/1kyu/do-you-still-use-reddit-alongside","score":48,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Do you still use Reddit alongside Ruqqus?","upvotes":50,"url":""},"post_id":"1kyu","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":0}
