Plenty others have been doing the same things as him but a lot longer, but don't get nearly as much attention.</p>\n<p>It annoys me because now this guy has a literal fucking personality cult built around him and even on this tiny website you can't go anywhere without him being shoved in your face 24/7 and people worshiping him for no reason. It's also very unfair to the other YouTubers who actually put the work in and took a long time to become famous like that, and even then they were never even close to where he is already. If this keeps going on he's going to have like more subs than PewDiePie, all for doing little more than existing.</p>\n<p>Of course, whenever I point this out people mass downvote me, because how dare I criticize their deities.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1595796061, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 1595796130, "fullname": "t3_509q", "guild_id": "1", "herald_guild": null, "id": "509q", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["4zye"], "permalink": "/+general/post/1kzo/current-minecraft-fanbase-be-like/509q", "post_id": "1kzo", "score": 1, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["509q"], "permalink": "/+general/post/1kzo/current-minecraft-fanbase-be-like/50jp", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 9, "created_utc": 1595783924, "domain": "i.imgur.com", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_1kzo", "guild_id": "1", "guild_name": "general", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1kzo", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+general/post/1kzo/current-minecraft-fanbase-be-like", "score": 8, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/1kzo/thumb.png", "title": "Current Minecraft fanbase be like", "upvotes": 10, "url": "https://i.imgur.com/QeT592D.png"}, "post_id": "1kzo", "score": 4, "upvotes": 4, "voted": 0}
