I was just pointing out how it would go by your logic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you even explain why there no define article when the logos of called theos in John's prologue, polytheist? Of course you can't. Can you explain or even adress, say, John 17:3? Of course you can't. You can't even define what a son is, and you've just denied the sonship of your \"saviour\" and a core doctrine of your own faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, yes I can. Articles aren't strictly necessary in the Greek language, and some writers used them and others did not. Generally, they were used for some noun cases but not others, however it's not exactly consistent. If you're claiming the lack of a definite article means it's referring to another god, that makes you the polytheist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You don't even know what Pharisaism entails, or who they were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes I do, they were the type who interpret everything literally and use it to proclaim their self righteousness and control others with made up rules that they can't even follow themselves. They talk about the speck in their brother's eye but have a log in their own eye.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you're the one that worships the death of your \"saviour\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, I don't. He had to die to pay the debt, but then overcame it and resurrected. That's an unspeakable act of love.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And at least the Pharisee acknowledged and worshipped (and still do) the one God alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They don't have the son, so they don't have the father also. They belonged to their father, the devil. And none of those are my words.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are infinitely better than you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, they were said to be worse than the pagans multiple times, not that the pagans were anywhere near good.</p>\n<p>In any case you're making this all out to be a much bigger deal than it actually is. The sonship isn't really described for a reason, because our minds can't comprehend it, we were given the two/one commandments to do for now, and we know what was done for us.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1606931960, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_imgw", "guild_id": "m3", "herald_guild": null, "id": "imgw", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 31, "parent_comment_id": ["ilk4"], "permalink": "/+Christian/post/1l3h/five-reasons-mlk-was-not-a/imgw", "post_id": "1l3h", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["imgw"], "permalink": "/+Christian/post/1l3h/five-reasons-mlk-was-not-a/ittc", "post": {"author_name": "WarmPotato", "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 56, "created_utc": 1595790381, "domain": "youtube.com", "downvotes": 6, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_1l3h", "guild_id": "m3", "guild_name": "Christian", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1l3h", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christian/post/1l3h/five-reasons-mlk-was-not-a", "score": 1, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/1l3h/thumb.png", "title": "Five Reasons MLK was NOT a True Christian", "upvotes": 7, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac15-jl8-3k"}, "post_id": "1l3h", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
