If I didn't care about Ruqqus I wouldn't bother to criticize anything.</p>\n<p>You're right that I'm miffed now. I can see why that might make you more weary of me <em>now</em>. However, I didn't complain at all until about a month ago, as I saw no issues yet, but you guys seemed to be avoiding me before then too. So what was it then, before my complaints started, that made you not want me around, is what I'm asking. I legitimately want to know this so I can improve in the future, as it's very hard to see your own faults. As of now I'm clueless and stuck in an endless loop.</p>\n","created_utc":1596031965,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_5c1e","guild_id":"2","herald_guild":null,"id":"5c1e","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent_comment_id":["5bq5"],"permalink":"/+Ruqqus/post/1o39/why-do-the-admins-hate-me/5c1e","post_id":"1o39","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["5c1e"],"permalink":"/+Ruqqus/post/1o39/why-do-the-admins-hate-me/5cco","post":{"guild_name":"Ruqqus","id":"1o39","is_banned":false,"is_deleted":true,"permalink":"/+Ruqqus/post/1o39/why-do-the-admins-hate-me","title":"Why do the admins hate me?"},"post_id":"1o39","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
