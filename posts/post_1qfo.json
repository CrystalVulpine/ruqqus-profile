Few contest that it refers to biological male and female as well as to the act itself. Gender is where most of the excitement is. So let\u2019s start where any reasonable discussion of the real meaning of a word must start, looking at its specific etymology. In doing so, we find gender has everything to do with the first, most basic, and natural fact of being human.\n\nFrom the 14th century, gender has referred to the essence of what male and female are, issuing from the Proto-Indo-European root gen- or gene-. It fundamentally references the creation, birth, and begetting of new human beings, as in, to generate or engender.\n\nThis root is also interestingly associated with the Latin gonos, from which we get our English word gonad. Of course, these are the uniquely determinative, wholly binary parts of our anatomy that cannot do what they do without their cooperative union with the body of the other gender. Gender refers to that which is inherently heterosexual.\n\nThus, gender\u2019s grammatical root\u2014gene/gen\u2014is also associated with such words as genesis, generation (both in terms of being generated as well as the historical time-frame one was generated) and yes, of course, genitals, those two unavoidably binary parts of the human anatomy that help our gonads and associated cooperative parts do what gonads do: generate. Finally, gender also derives from the Latin genus meaning race, kin, family, kind, order, and species, that generative line from which another comes and thus belongs to.\n\nIf anything is the furthest thing from being a mere social construct, gender is. So the words \u201csex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d are indeed two objective sides of the same coin. Anyone who says differently is just making stuff up. This is precisely what the gender theorists are doing.

Few contest that it refers to biological male and female as well as to the act itself. Gender is where most of the excitement is. So let\u2019s start where any reasonable discussion of the real meaning of a word must start, looking at its specific etymology. In doing so, we find gender has everything to do with the first, most basic, and natural fact of being human.\n\nFrom the 14th century, gender has referred to the essence of what male and female are, issuing from the Proto-Indo-European root gen- or gene-. It fundamentally references the creation, birth, and begetting of new human beings, as in, to generate or engender.\n\nThis root is also interestingly associated with the Latin gonos, from which we get our English word gonad. Of course, these are the uniquely determinative, wholly binary parts of our anatomy that cannot do what they do without their cooperative union with the body of the other gender. Gender refers to that which is inherently heterosexual.\n\nThus, gender\u2019s grammatical root\u2014gene/gen\u2014is also associated with such words as genesis, generation (both in terms of being generated as well as the historical time-frame one was generated) and yes, of course, genitals, those two unavoidably binary parts of the human anatomy that help our gonads and associated cooperative parts do what gonads do: generate. Finally, gender also derives from the Latin genus meaning race, kin, family, kind, order, and species, that generative line from which another comes and thus belongs to.\n\nIf anything is the furthest thing from being a mere social construct, gender is. So the words \u201csex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d are indeed two objective sides of the same coin. Anyone who says differently is just making stuff up. This is precisely what the gender theorists are doing. Next we must address gender theory\u2019s \u201ccreative\u201d relationship with science.\n\nhttps://www.etymonline.com/word/*gene-?ref=etymonline_crossreference\n\nhttps://www.etymonline.com/search?q=gonads\n\n\"nearly no one employed the word until the late 1970s. But the surprising finding was what academic disciplines did and did not adopt it. Only the softer sociological, humanities, and psychiatric disciplines started using \u201cgender\u201d in the late \u201870s and in immediately increasing numbers. The harder, natural sciences were far less likely to use the word and not likely to attach any new meaning to it.\n\nWhen asked, those scholars working in the biological and natural sciences who did use the term in greater numbers reported doing so for the following three reasons: 1) to \u201csignal sympathy with feminist goals,\u201d 2) to use a more in vogue, academic-sounding term, or 3) linguistically to avoid the connotation of copulation.\"\n\nFeminism, the movement that has completely destroyed male and female relationships in every aspect, is the reason for this absolute bullshit that is based on ideologies and NOT science.", "body_html": "<p>The academics are the ones who were paid to write that shit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/15/why-sex-and-gender-are-not-two-different-things/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/15/why-sex-and-gender-are-not-two-different-things/</a></p>\n<p>The Meaning of Words\nThe word sex has not really been in contention until the Supreme Court deliberations.
