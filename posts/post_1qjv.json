Instead they need to work hard because they want to improve the nation and not drag others down.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1596216365, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_5lt0", "guild_id": "1v", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5lt0", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["5lmr"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/1qjv/what-is-the-best-form-of/5lt0", "post_id": "1qjv", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["5lt0"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/1qjv/what-is-the-best-form-of/5m0w", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "I'll go first: as little government and as deep into libright as possible.
