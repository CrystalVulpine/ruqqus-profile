They hold no beliefs beyond 'I am against whatever they're for', they're think they're conservative, because they vaguely believe in gun rights and vote Republican. Most of them have very little to say about the negatives of Capitalism, the rise of secularism, the toleration of abortion, and the various social problems.</p>\n<p>The left is cancerous, but at least the left has an ideology it is propelling, might be incoherent, but even shit sticks once in a while. Meanwhile, the right doesn't achieve anything, it just spends it time grasping at victories completely out of its hand, such as \"record employment\" or \"record GDP growth\", which are quite frankly mostly out of the hands of governments anyway. The right just spends its existence on the back foot defending whatever insanity the left comes up with next, but when it has the advantage it never seizes it by shaping a different way forward.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1596324908, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_5ro6", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#7B9AE4", "created_utc": 1582833064, "description": "Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?
