It ignores so many potential psychological repercussions on developing children, creating increases in the feeling of isolation, making communication harder (especially for, say, deaf people who lip read).  I also believe any government restriction such as this needs an explicit condition for it to end and can never be allowed to be indefinite.  Anyone proposing a mask requirement without proposing a clear end date to the requirement is just taking power that they never plan to relinquish, just like the TSA after 9/11.  This should terrify any thinking person.  There's also the impact on people with claustrophobia like my mother, or mild asthma like myself.  People unironically make the claim that it's \"not a big deal\", which to me is just a factually ignorant claim.\n\nAll of those are common arguments that people could argue one way or the other.  I think there's a completely rock solid argument that's totally independent though, which is that mask mandates among the general population will not save a single life even if they happened to be effective in slowing the spread.  This is because herd immunity (through infection) is the only realistic end to the virus.\n\nThere are 3 ways in which the 'rona pandemic can end:\n1) Global eradication, (completely not going to happen given how infectious the virus is)\n2) Herd immunity through sufficient vaccination (not going to happen anytime soon; the quickest we've ever created a vaccine is in 4 years, and we've never created a vaccine for a coronavirus.  I'd be shocked if the end of year predictions were true, and even that seems way too slow to beat (3) in the timetable especially when you consider the time needed after getting a vaccine to produce it and disseminate it, and this doesn't even begin to consider whether the vaccine might be less safe than usual due to rushing through the testing process)\n3) Herd immunity through infection.  This is why the virus has largely died out in much of Europe.  No, it wasn't \"because of lockdown\", just look at Sweden.  The same thing happens; you reach enough infected, and the virus stops finding enough uninfected new hosts.  People try to claim that low serology results indicate this hasn't happened, but it's pretty impossible to get around the evidence that cases just start going away at a certain point regardless of the nation's policy decisions.\n\nWhat this means is that you have to have roughly the same fixed percent of your population infected to beat this.  Because the hospital overwhelmed thing turned out to be a complete non-issue (just look at the extra hospitals that were never used) there's no reason to flatten the curve, so you might as well just get it over with.  Slowing the spread, ergo, does not save lives ultimately, therefore there is no upside to masks, only downsides.  Even the slightest inconvenience therefore should be completely unacceptable to stopping the spread, because it is downside with no upside.\n\nThat is the broad point, but now I'm going to add a little nuance and explain the niche circumstance where what I just said could be wrong.  We know that the 'rona mainly kills the elderly, and that it's less deadly than the flu for young people.  Therefore while the number of total cases for herd immunity may be roughly fixed, the number of deaths and the human suffering is actually slightly malleable.  If we infect young people instead of old people, we reduce the death toll.  Thus if you want to impose measures on your most vulnerable for a short time while NOT doing so on people who are relatively young so that they get the disease while the more at risk don't, then you might save lives if your measures are effective.  In my mind, this could justify some amount of intervention for nursing homes, and maybe the truly severely immuno-compromised.  I think we need to be careful though; people in nursing homes typically have very little time left on this earth, and they may prefer seeing their families in person and unmasked to being alone but safe.  Ultimately this risk-reward tradeoff should be made at the nursing home and individual level in my mind and should entirely be outside the realm of government, or maybe at most the government could spend money on making sure at risk people have assistance if they want it.  I'm a more libertarian leaning chap myself and don't care much for big government spending, but I get that opinions differ here and I'd massively prefer a targeted approach towards people who really need help to the mad lockdown and government spending orgy that's happened here in the USA.\n\nI think the whole thing is utterly baffling.  Up until 2020, nobody considered lockdowns as a plausible strategy against disease.  At the start, people just wanted to flatten the curve because they all recognized you couldn't eradicate it, and yet for some reason people now seem to think we can either eradicate it or wait until a vaccine magically appears.  People somehow have convinced themselves this vaccine will be 100% effective, will be here soon, and is guaranteed to be possible despite no coronavirus vaccine ever having been successfully created.  They have no answer for \"what happens if we can't make a vaccine?\".  Worse, people now claim we always intended to lock down forever.  But that's not the only revisionism we've experienced.\n\nThe masks seem to have become popular after the BLM protests.  My opinion is that initially the media railed against anyone protesting lockdown; I've seen things as extreme as wishing death upon people for having these views differing from the media orthodoxy on the virus.  However, it was politically forbidden to be too harsh on the BLM protests.  Regardless of how you feel about that movement, you can't deny that the media treated the two very differently.  Normally I would hope nearly everyone supports the right to protest regardless of whether you agree in the cause, but in this case one was considered okay, even virtuous, while the other abhorrent.  The justification that I saw seemed to be that the BLM protesters were more likely to wear masks, and after that the mask thing caught steam.  To me, it feels like a psychological trick to make people feel like they're \"doing something\".  It's virtue signalling at its finest.  People get so emotional about their obsessive desire to mask people; it's like they want to feel in control, and they want their \"team\" to be identifiable by a uniform.  What's more is that people now act like masks always made sense, and all the things that were initially said about them not being shown to work are now irrelevant.  Again, revisionism; we were always at war with Eastasia, covid-1984, etc.\n\nThis turned into a bit of a rant, but the tl;dr and crux of my argument is that I don't recognize a point in slowing the spread.  I think we've lost the common sense understanding that the curve has to happen and herd immunity has to achieved and have instead dived into totalitarian madness.  All of the anti-'rona measures seem to be aimed at slowing the spread, and they just don't make sense to me unless you really buy into the magic vaccine will save us thing.  And then on top of that you'd have to prove to me that the masks actually do enough to be effective at stopping the spread, and then you'd have to prove to me that the virus is deadly enough that we should give up our liberties for it.","body_html":"<p>There are a number of commonly made arguments I would support.
