Waiting until 25 has it's upsides, like a reduced rate of teenage/young adult pregnancy and a lower std rate, but it has it's downsides. In South Korea, they have actually banned internet porn and have the age of consent at 20, so I agree with South Korea on this issue.</p>\n<p>Also, still upvoted btw.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1596954558, "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_6onu", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#7B9AE4", "created_utc": 1582833064, "description": "Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?

If a 13 year old decides to fuck a 15 year old and gets pregnant, that's perfectly legal and they are \"adult\" enough to choose to make a life altering decision to keep the baby, but not adult enough to choose to have that sex with an older person. A 16 year old is \"adult\" enough to drive a 3 ton death machine at 80 miles an hour on a road with hundreds of other death machines, but they arent adult enough to vote. An 18 year old is adult enough to vote for our representatives, fight and die for our country, and sign up for hundreds of thousands of dollars in life altering debt, but they arent adult enough to have a beer. A 21 year old is adult enough to drink, but not adult enough to rent a car. A 25 year old is adult enough to do everything.... except run for senate or president. You cant be president until you reach 35 years of age.</p>\n<p>This is fucking crazy. You are either an adult or you are not. Idgaf where the line is drawn, but there should be ONE LINE, and anything on one side should be illegal on the other.

More than half of the $700 million, and $6.6 million of the $41 million, was spent on sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 just one indication of the continent\u2019s importance to the new policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/africa/us-support-of-gay-rights-in-africa-may-have-done-more-harm-than-good.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/africa/us-support-of-gay-rights-in-africa-may-have-done-more-harm-than-good.html</a></p>\n<p>Why in God's name are they promoting sexual activity which leads to HIV being spread in places where there is an HIV epidemic? Are they trying to destroy Africans the same way their colonial ancestors did? Reminds me of how Europeans spread diseases in the Americas to kill of the native populations. Perhaps HIV is the ultimate birth control and they want Africans to have it.</p>\n<p>So not only are your societies degenerate when it comes to sex, you want to spread your degeneracy everywhere.

Of course Taliban have problems, and did bad things, and there are lots of messed up things in Afghanistan, but perhaps the situation would not be as bad as it is now if the Americans never invaded in the first place.\r\n\r\nYou telling me your experience in Afghanistan did not refute the central point of my argument, which is that western societies are promoting this type of degeneracy in these places. Here is another one, Donald Trump said this, imagine how much more messed up the left would be:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-launches-global-effort-end-criminalization-homosexuality-n973081\r\n\r\nIt is interesting they are supporting all of this LGBT garbage while at the same time fighting to keep homosexuals who rape boys in power.\r\n\r\n>I also saw plenty of Taliban taking bachi boys themselves, and raping women, and murdering children.\r\n\r\nEven with this, you can still use the lesser of two evil arguments here.\r\n\r\n>You know what, you aren't even worth bothering with, you fucking degenerate lying piece of shit. Everything you have said here is twisted bullshit to push an agenda and spread lies about countries you've probably never stepped foot in. Go fuck yourself.\r\n\r\nLol, you mad. If you have been to Afghanistan then you can give me some insight into the situation there, how messed up things are there. I already know there are many things in these countries that are messed up, but whataboutism does not refute that western societies not only have many degeneracies, but actively celebrate it (ie celebrating homosexuality). Eastern countries don't celebrate it, talk to any Afghan about the homosexuality in their country, they will be ashamed of it, talk to an Englishman about the homosexuality in their country, they would be proud of it. At least Afghans acknowledge that homosexuality is wrong, unlike westerners. That is one of the key differences between these societies.\r\n\r\nThink how in Afghanistan, a conservative Muslim society that frowns upon homosexuality, there is a big homosexual sexual abuse of boy problem there. Who is to say that it cannot happen in western societies? With how the LGBT movement is going, it would not surprise me if in the future it will be considered homophobic for boys to refuse to be raped by men.

Of course Taliban have problems, and did bad things, and there are lots of messed up things in Afghanistan, but perhaps the situation would not be as bad as it is now if the Americans never invaded in the first place.</p>\n<p>You telling me your experience in Afghanistan did not refute the central point of my argument, which is that western societies are promoting this type of degeneracy in these places. Here is another one, Donald Trump said this, imagine how much more messed up the left would be:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-launches-global-effort-end-criminalization-homosexuality-n973081\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-launches-global-effort-end-criminalization-homosexuality-n973081</a></p>\n<p>It is interesting they are supporting all of this LGBT garbage while at the same time fighting to keep homosexuals who rape boys in power.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also saw plenty of Taliban taking bachi boys themselves, and raping women, and murdering children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even with this, you can still use the lesser of two evil arguments here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You know what, you aren't even worth bothering with, you fucking degenerate lying piece of shit. Everything you have said here is twisted bullshit to push an agenda and spread lies about countries you've probably never stepped foot in. Go fuck yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lol, you mad. If you have been to Afghanistan then you can give me some insight into the situation there, how messed up things are there. I already know there are many things in these countries that are messed up, but whataboutism does not refute that western societies not only have many degeneracies, but actively celebrate it (ie celebrating homosexuality). Eastern countries don't celebrate it, talk to any Afghan about the homosexuality in their country, they will be ashamed of it, talk to an Englishman about the homosexuality in their country, they would be proud of it. At least Afghans acknowledge that homosexuality is wrong, unlike westerners. That is one of the key differences between these societies.</p>\n<p>Think how in Afghanistan, a conservative Muslim society that frowns upon homosexuality, there is a big homosexual sexual abuse of boy problem there. Who is to say that it cannot happen in western societies? With how the LGBT movement is going, it would not surprise me if in the future it will be considered homophobic for boys to refuse to be raped by men. It is considered transphobic for lesbians to refuse to have sexual relationships with so called transbians.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1597013530, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_6r9x", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#7B9AE4", "created_utc": 1582833064, "description": "Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?
