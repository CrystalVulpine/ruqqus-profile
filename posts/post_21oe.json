(And obviously, I didn't take it.)\r\n\r\nI feel that some questions don't have enough answers to represent the range of views you may come across. For example, one of the questions is \"What kind of speech, if any, should be regulated?\". What if someone believes, for example, that \"false advertising\" is both a form of speech and should be banned? (Note: I wrote this before you added the \"No opinion\" option.)\r\n\r\nComments/questions on wording and other things:\r\n\r\n>What best describes your ideal form of government?\r\n\r\n>It is too large, and needs to become smaller and play a more limited role in people's lives.\r\n\r\nThe original question never mentioned the current American government. Something like \"It should play a limited role in people's lives\" may be better (though from this, I'm not sure what that \"role\" is.)\r\n\r\n>How should we deal with disadvantaged or minority groups?\r\n\r\n>We should stop engaging in identity politics and distinguishing different groups.\r\n\r\nWhat about those who are in poverty?
