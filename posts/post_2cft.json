My only sources atm are reddit, google, imgur, gfycat, and hourly flops. Those are great for finding long-time popular reposts, but all except the latter are terrible for discovering <em>new</em> (quality) content. (Hourly flops is good, but people are clearly getting their content from many more sources than just that, and hourly flops only has pics, no videos/gifs).</p>\n<p>So, those of you who find a bunch of new fox pics and gifs all the time, what gives? Where are you getting them from, and where do you find them at?</p>\n<p>Edit: Foxposters, show yourselves! I'm pinning this post so people who come to this guild in the future will see it and can find your foxy content sources.</p>\n<p>Edit 2: Someone just gave me a bunch of sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://t.me/HourlyFops\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hourly Fops</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://t.me/FennecFriends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fennec Friends</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://t.me/redtaily\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RedTaily</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://t.me/foxposting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Foxposting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoolFoxAccount\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coolfoxaccount</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hourlyFox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hourlyFox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://foxrudor.de/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://foxrudor.de/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fox-info.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://fox-info.net/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JuniperFox/videos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Juniper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEFbQHfI-iiez0NBr6ZV1g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alice the Fox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/SaveAFox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SaveAFox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvbRv7guDemGXy12jyk4ZzA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loki the Red Fox</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apparently following these on telegram/twitter will cause the algorithms to find more of them and suggest them to you, so that's how these people always manage to discover these niche accounts/websites.</p>\n", "comment_count": 13, "created_utc": 1597715682, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1597766237, "fullname": "t2_2cft", "guild_id": "rt", "guild_name": "foxes", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2cft", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": true, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+foxes/post/2cft/where-are-people-finding-all-these", "score": 34, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Where are people finding all these pictures and videos of foxes?", "upvotes": 35, "url": ""}, "post_id": "2cft", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
