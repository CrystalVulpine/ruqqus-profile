So if you already saw this post, I apologize, and you can ignore it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I started my first programming about 8 years ago in Java. It didn't get serious until about 4 years ago however, and a year after that I started C and C++.</p>\n<p>I find it fun and enjoyable building things. Needless to say though, as much as I like it and do it a lot, I fucking suck, like I do at pretty much everything in life.</p>\n<p>All the people I've met in programming channels on this site, discord, github, etc could finish even my biggest projects, which took me weeks, in a day or even mere hours, by putting in about half as much effort. Most people can finish several semi-professional projects in a month, albeit small, and each one takes them only a few hours to make, and a few days to <em>finish</em>, entirely by themselves. They can also take a few months to build very complex applications, by themselves. I have <em>never</em> made anything even remotely releasable in my whole life, just a bunch of shit that only I can use, and it always has a ton of problems that I can never figure out and every one of my solutions is half-baked. In fact, most of my intended projects never even end up being able to execute at all, let alone become mature. I run into so many problems that I have probably never written more than 100 lines in a day, even though most people can do thousands. Everything I do is just out of boredom too, I can't even write a small program that's actually useful in any way. In a nutshell, \"hello world\" is still the only thing I can make that's fully in working order.</p>\n<p>Most devs also seem to know just about every single language in existence, no sweat. Not just a \"I kinda know how to use it\" deal, an actual rich understanding of all of them, knowing all the nooks and crannies of each one. Me? I know Java, C, and C++. And even those I don't have a particularly good understanding of, just enough to get things done. I have to google even very basic things that even people who don't use those as their main language would know about. I am also completely unable to make anything for platforms other than the one I'm currently using. No raspberry pi, no android, no web apps, nothing. I can't use CMake or anything either, because I'm still too busy figuring out everything else after so many years.</p>\n<p>Wtf is wrong with me? Why am I so bad?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Some people in my last post weren't believing me, so here is an example of some devs who frequently make simple, small projects that should be trivial to complete.
