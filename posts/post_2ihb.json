", "body_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>What are the left's legitimate grievances?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically the shit that happened to them in the 80's/90's that older generations ignored or told them to get over because they feared dealing with them would collapse their communities.</p>\n<p>You know those #MeToo folks who have come out of the woodwork? Most of them actually are not lying. That's why they're so insistent that they be believed -- the vast majority actually are real, legit rape and domestic abuse survivors who are telling the truth but can't prove their story, but still want/need justice to be able to recover from what happened to them. They were told repeatedly throughout their lives to get over it, because openly exposing the rapists/child molesters/abusers who hurt them would create a huge civil rights problem that our legal system is not properly equipped to address at all.</p>\n<p>We have a system that relies on proof over consensus, but that system doesn't take into account behind-closed-door crimes for which a victim is either woefully unprepared to or is physically incapable of collecting evidence/proof that what happened to them really happened. All they have to go on is their credibility which is easily torn into shreds in court. It's so easily torn to shreds because, under the surface, most people in their communities are aware of this and they know that if that rapist is punished on the basis of little to no evidence that it would set an ugly precedent which would carry us down the road to where we are now. That's why they would tell rape and abuse victims to just get over it -- they valued the stability of the community more than the lives of these people, and so purposefully and willingly sacrificed rape and abuse victims to preserve the stability of liberal democracy.</p>\n<p>That's why SJWs are so authoritarian and it's why they deconstruct the American legal and philosophical system so much, and it's why they frame what they're doing as progress and claim civil/human rights are anachronistic: in their minds, it IS progress because they're addressing a very real flaw in our legal system.</p>\n<p>They just can't see that they're addressing that flaw in the most ass way possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My grievances with the left are that they actively hate this country, want to destroy it, want to take things that don't belong to them, and openly call for the death of my race and gender. These are mainstream left things. I do not see equivalent bullshit in the mainstream right, and I'm damn close to center, not some alt-right, Jew hating asshole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same nuances exist among the left and they perceive the center and the right in the same way. Since, like I said above, this is all based entirely on their childhood experiences from the 80's and 90's, they still think the rest of the world holds the anachronistic and bigoted views people held back in those times, and it's those views they're fighting against. They literally never actually thought or considered that we're in 2020 now and people don't think like that anymore, not because of them but because of the successes of the gay rights movement from the 00's. They're literally fighting spectres from their past because they think that's how the world is now, and most importantly, <strong>they never thought to critically or rationally think about the things they're saying, believing or doing.</strong></p>\n<p>Most of what they believe about the right wing is based on lies, and that's because they're being heavily propagandized. Every single redneck joke you've ever seen a liberal make, every time you've ever heard of them label their opponents as white-trash hillbillies that don't know what's good for them, every single time you've heard of them refer to a Southern state in a disparaging way knowing full-well they've either never been to those places or only interacted with back-woods, uneducated, poor white families who they grew up around and came to detest, they are appealing to a racist stereotype, and they're doing that because of decades of negative, racist propaganda that's been fed to them.</p>\n<p>They don't see it as propaganda, they don't recognize it as propaganda, <strong>they see it as objective fact.</strong> That's the key to understanding everything an SJW does: they treat everything they are told and everything they believe is an objective fact and that everyone who disagrees with them is just wrong.

I don't blame you for defending what you were taught, it's like someone telling you your religion was wrong and a lie all this time.

He had medical conditions and if he actually did do half the shit that's accused on him, he'd have died a lot sooner than 1945. Some of his decision making was affected by the fact he knew he didn't have much time. Hitler demoted many people that acted against Germany or were defeatist.

There's been many lies told about it, but what you're not told is that there were Muslim, Arab, Chinese, African, and Slavs that were a part of the SS. ![](https://files.catbox.moe/oxbsrc.JPG). It wasn't a \"whites only\" club as jew media implies, it was to secure the homogeneus societies of EACH nation, not just Germany. Hitler believed every nation should preserve its people, culture, histories in their own ways. Because it was catching on, and people found pride in their nations and refused to mix with outside breeds; Churchill started agitating for war. Churchill, by the way, was financed by jewish businessmen in an organization called The Focus Group. They owned him. \r\n\r\n> trading military bases for 50 ww1 destroyers = war?\r\n\r\nYes, per the Geneva Convention. A neutral country is not allowed to sell arms to a nation that is engaged in war. That is taking a side, ergo an action of war. Roosevelt (Who was also owned by jews the same as Churchill) ![](https://files.catbox.moe/uzkfsz.jpg) wanted to give Britain ships and war supplies, but it was illegal. So he came up with \"Lend Lease\" which circumvented the law, and also scrapped Britain out of everything they held. It was 2006 before Britain finished paying the US off for it's WWII debt. \r\n\r\nThe US was supposed to be neutral, the people didn't want war, and Roosevelt (Rosenfeld) didn't have the authority to declare war on his own. That is why he let Pearl Harbor (after instigating it) happen; to anger the people enough to want to support going to war. \r\n\r\n> When did this happen?\r\n\r\nUpon England declaring war on Germany. The US was still neutral but did it \"in the interest of national security\". Similar to how they rounded up Japs and threw them into **concentration camps** around the US. \r\n\r\n> wow i never knew america is currently at war with china, those sanctions and their hidden message\r\n\r\nMost of that is just smoke to scare us into another world war, nuclear war, etc. etc. \"Never let a tragedy go to waste\" - Joe Biden. It's more of an act of TREASON because our corrupted politicians (they're ALL corrupt - you don't get to that position today without being corrupt) gave them our jobs and technology which severely WEAKENED us, and STRENGTHENED a COMMUNIST NATION, who would otherwise be starving. \r\n\r\n> do you not understand what a convoy escort is? or a trade protection zone?\r\n\r\nGermany issued newspaper bulletins, cables, advertisements WARNING the US to STAY OUT of the warzone. They warned it's A WAR ZONE, if you enter it YOU MIGHT GET HIT! But we weren't worried about being attacked, Roosevelt actually wanted that because it would get support for going to war. Instead, US ships sank German submarines. The US acted first, not Germany. This is what the Jewish press will not tell people. \r\n\r\n> then that would mean trump commited treason too, invasion was expected but they didnt know where, 8 battleships sunk just for a war declaration?\r\n\r\nEvery US President since Woodrow Wilson has committed treason to some extent. They are merely puppets at this point. Wilson should have hanged for the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Income Tax, and creation of the IRS as it's unconstitutional and gives our livelihoods to a 3rd party alien to this country. Trump attacks the constitution just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, Regan, Carter, ALL OF THEM. Jewish conspirators see the constitution as a major hurdle in subverting this country. It was written in DIRECT OPPOSITION to governmental tyranny, which is what they want. Ever wonder why Israel never gets negative press? Look what they do to black people over there ![](https://files.catbox.moe/p1z7jr.jpg) yet not ONE WORD on Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Wiki, - well, we all know who owns those outlets. \r\n\r\n> again more whataboutism, i dont defend allied war crimes, source for that quote? also no civillian could be considered innocent, you have the volksturm to thank for that\r\n\r\nNot whataboutism, it's holding one to their words and actions. If you're going to act, be consistent. If you aren't, you are a hypocrite and a liar, a dishonest person that shouldn't be leading people or holding any political office. The source for the quote is Patton himself. His family released the Patton Papers in 1970, which completely destroyed the US's interests for going to war.

We were reading all their communications, we knew their strategy, when they'd act and where.

The US was still neutral but did it \"in the interest of national security\". Similar to how they rounded up Japs and threw them into <strong>concentration camps</strong> around the US.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wow i never knew america is currently at war with china, those sanctions and their hidden message</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of that is just smoke to scare us into another world war, nuclear war, etc. etc. \"Never let a tragedy go to waste\" - Joe Biden. It's more of an act of TREASON because our corrupted politicians (they're ALL corrupt - you don't get to that position today without being corrupt) gave them our jobs and technology which severely WEAKENED us, and STRENGTHENED a COMMUNIST NATION, who would otherwise be starving.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>do you not understand what a convoy escort is? or a trade protection zone?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Germany issued newspaper bulletins, cables, advertisements WARNING the US to STAY OUT of the warzone. They warned it's A WAR ZONE, if you enter it YOU MIGHT GET HIT! But we weren't worried about being attacked, Roosevelt actually wanted that because it would get support for going to war. Instead, US ships sank German submarines. The US acted first, not Germany. This is what the Jewish press will not tell people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>then that would mean trump commited treason too, invasion was expected but they didnt know where, 8 battleships sunk just for a war declaration?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every US President since Woodrow Wilson has committed treason to some extent. They are merely puppets at this point. Wilson should have hanged for the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Income Tax, and creation of the IRS as it's unconstitutional and gives our livelihoods to a 3rd party alien to this country. Trump attacks the constitution just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, Regan, Carter, ALL OF THEM. Jewish conspirators see the constitution as a major hurdle in subverting this country. It was written in DIRECT OPPOSITION to governmental tyranny, which is what they want. Ever wonder why Israel never gets negative press?

David Irving, a British Historian and Author, [debunks the Holocaust in 3 minutes.](https://archive.org/details/DavidIrvingDebunksHolocaustIn3Min)\r\n\r\nThe SS was a volunteer group. There's been many lies told about it, but what you're not told is that there were Muslim, Arab, Chinese, African, and Slavs that were a part of the SS. ![](https://files.catbox.moe/oxbsrc.JPG). It wasn't a \"whites only\" club as jew media implies, it was to secure the homogeneus societies of EACH nation, not just Germany. Hitler believed every nation should preserve its people, culture, histories in their own ways. Because it was catching on, and people found pride in their nations and refused to mix with outside breeds; Churchill started agitating for war. Churchill, by the way, was financed by jewish businessmen in an organization called The Focus Group. They owned him. \r\n\r\n> trading military bases for 50 ww1 destroyers = war?\r\n\r\nYes, per the Geneva Convention. A neutral country is not allowed to sell arms to a nation that is engaged in war. That is taking a side, ergo an action of war. Roosevelt (Who was also owned by jews the same as Churchill) ![](https://files.catbox.moe/uzkfsz.jpg) wanted to give Britain ships and war supplies, but it was illegal. So he came up with \"Lend Lease\" which circumvented the law, and also scrapped Britain out of everything they held. It was 2006 before Britain finished paying the US off for it's WWII debt. \r\n\r\nThe US was supposed to be neutral, the people didn't want war, and Roosevelt (Rosenfeld) didn't have the authority to declare war on his own. That is why he let Pearl Harbor (after instigating it) happen; to anger the people enough to want to support going to war. \r\n\r\n> When did this happen?\r\n\r\nUpon England declaring war on Germany. The US was still neutral but did it \"in the interest of national security\". Similar to how they rounded up Japs and threw them into **concentration camps** around the US. \r\n\r\n> wow i never knew america is currently at war with china, those sanctions and their hidden message\r\n\r\nMost of that is just smoke to scare us into another world war, nuclear war, etc. etc. \"Never let a tragedy go to waste\" - Joe Biden. It's more of an act of TREASON because our corrupted politicians (they're ALL corrupt - you don't get to that position today without being corrupt) gave them our jobs and technology which severely WEAKENED us, and STRENGTHENED a COMMUNIST NATION, who would otherwise be starving. \r\n\r\n> do you not understand what a convoy escort is? or a trade protection zone?\r\n\r\nGermany issued newspaper bulletins, cables, advertisements WARNING the US to STAY OUT of the warzone. They warned it's A WAR ZONE, if you enter it YOU MIGHT GET HIT! But we weren't worried about being attacked, Roosevelt actually wanted that because it would get support for going to war. Instead, US ships sank German submarines. The US acted first, not Germany. This is what the Jewish press will not tell people. \r\n\r\n> then that would mean trump commited treason too, invasion was expected but they didnt know where, 8 battleships sunk just for a war declaration?\r\n\r\nEvery US President since Woodrow Wilson has committed treason to some extent. They are merely puppets at this point. Wilson should have hanged for the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Income Tax, and creation of the IRS as it's unconstitutional and gives our livelihoods to a 3rd party alien to this country. Trump attacks the constitution just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, Regan, Carter, ALL OF THEM. Jewish conspirators see the constitution as a major hurdle in subverting this country.

It wasn't a \"whites only\" club as jew media implies, it was to secure the homogeneus societies of EACH nation, not just Germany. Hitler believed every nation should preserve its people, culture, histories in their own ways. Because it was catching on, and people found pride in their nations and refused to mix with outside breeds; Churchill started agitating for war. Churchill, by the way, was financed by jewish businessmen in an organization called The Focus Group. They owned him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>trading military bases for 50 ww1 destroyers = war?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, per the Geneva Convention. A neutral country is not allowed to sell arms to a nation that is engaged in war. That is taking a side, ergo an action of war.

So he came up with \"Lend Lease\" which circumvented the law, and also scrapped Britain out of everything they held. It was 2006 before Britain finished paying the US off for it's WWII debt.</p>\n<p>The US was supposed to be neutral, the people didn't want war, and Roosevelt (Rosenfeld) didn't have the authority to declare war on his own. That is why he let Pearl Harbor (after instigating it) happen; to anger the people enough to want to support going to war.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When did this happen?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Upon England declaring war on Germany. The US was still neutral but did it \"in the interest of national security\". Similar to how they rounded up Japs and threw them into <strong>concentration camps</strong> around the US.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wow i never knew america is currently at war with china, those sanctions and their hidden message</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of that is just smoke to scare us into another world war, nuclear war, etc. etc. \"Never let a tragedy go to waste\" - Joe Biden. It's more of an act of TREASON because our corrupted politicians (they're ALL corrupt - you don't get to that position today without being corrupt) gave them our jobs and technology which severely WEAKENED us, and STRENGTHENED a COMMUNIST NATION, who would otherwise be starving.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>do you not understand what a convoy escort is? or a trade protection zone?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Germany issued newspaper bulletins, cables, advertisements WARNING the US to STAY OUT of the warzone. They warned it's A WAR ZONE, if you enter it YOU MIGHT GET HIT! But we weren't worried about being attacked, Roosevelt actually wanted that because it would get support for going to war. Instead, US ships sank German submarines. The US acted first, not Germany. This is what the Jewish press will not tell people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>then that would mean trump commited treason too, invasion was expected but they didnt know where, 8 battleships sunk just for a war declaration?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every US President since Woodrow Wilson has committed treason to some extent. They are merely puppets at this point. Wilson should have hanged for the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Income Tax, and creation of the IRS as it's unconstitutional and gives our livelihoods to a 3rd party alien to this country. Trump attacks the constitution just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, Regan, Carter, ALL OF THEM. Jewish conspirators see the constitution as a major hurdle in subverting this country. It was written in DIRECT OPPOSITION to governmental tyranny, which is what they want. Ever wonder why Israel never gets negative press?

If you're going to act, be consistent. If you aren't, you are a hypocrite and a liar, a dishonest person that shouldn't be leading people or holding any political office. The source for the quote is Patton himself. His family released the Patton Papers in 1970, which completely destroyed the US's interests for going to war.

We desperately need a better way of doing things, because we cannot allow innocent people to be thrown in jail for something they didn't do, and we absolutely cannot allow our own people to rape, violate, and abuse each other on a mass scale like what's apparently been happening -- and denying it's happening simply because these people have no proof will do nothing but fuel the fire.\r\n\r\nI fear that won't happen though, because the SJWs are sick of it and the right wing is sick of them resorting to every destructive means available to achieve their objective. Both sides are very severely harming the other and neither side can really afford to compromise on the issue because the costs are simply too high. Expecting one side to just suck it up and deal with it simply is not realistic, is not just, and is absolutely cruel. \r\n\r\nWarfare might really be the only realistic end result here, with all of the bloodshed, atrocities, and horrors it entails. And at the end of it, the problem still won't likely be solved because it is a human and an evolutionary one, not a legal one.

When the whole point of rights is to prevent people from violating them and punish them when they do anyway?</p>\n<p>The truth is that for civil and moral progress to continue, we need a better legal system and a better system of civil/human rights that take these facts into account. We desperately need a better way of doing things, because we cannot allow innocent people to be thrown in jail for something they didn't do, and we absolutely cannot allow our own people to rape, violate, and abuse each other on a mass scale like what's apparently been happening -- and denying it's happening simply because these people have no proof will do nothing but fuel the fire.</p>\n<p>I fear that won't happen though, because the SJWs are sick of it and the right wing is sick of them resorting to every destructive means available to achieve their objective. Both sides are very severely harming the other and neither side can really afford to compromise on the issue because the costs are simply too high. Expecting one side to just suck it up and deal with it simply is not realistic, is not just, and is absolutely cruel.</p>\n<p>Warfare might really be the only realistic end result here, with all of the bloodshed, atrocities, and horrors it entails. And at the end of it, the problem still won't likely be solved because it is a human and an evolutionary one, not a legal one. I greatly fear for the future of this country because of it -- I highly doubt we'll even <em>be</em> a country within the next year or two, because of this shit.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1598172552, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1598172679, "fullname": "t3_8jdg", "guild_id": "1v", "herald_guild": null, "id": "8jdg", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 7, "parent_comment_id": ["8jc5"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/2ihb/is-anybody-else-tired-of-all/8jdg", "post_id": "2ihb", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["8jdg"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/2ihb/is-anybody-else-tired-of-all/9q70", "post": {"author_name": "Buttclit", "award_count": 0, "body": "It\u2019s incredible that it\u2019s too much to ask to just be simply informed, everyone out there trying to convince you of something.
