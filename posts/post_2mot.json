[...] loop through DOM elements [...]\"\r\nDon't drink from the firehose :). Poorly designed languages and bad APIs are NOT your fault. The current state of software development is garbage. I feel awful for Gen Z / the newer folks getting into it. You are sold a sterilized view of what serious programming is about, but most software is a hot mess. Take a break from producing code for other people. If that means skipping assignments/work/etc, do it. In my case, I saved what little desire I had left to code by writing an emulator front-end. It was totally superfluous, but it worked exactly the way I wanted it to, and it was fun to make. YOU NEED SIMILAR PROJECTS. Small ones that only you care about. Programming, in terms of a career/hobby, is a marathon - not a sprint. Don't let agile warriors fool you :). Fuck the latest JavaScript API. You will learn it when you need it and then forget it. Just make sure you actually know how to write loops as a matter of principle - basic logical competencies of the field - and learn your limitations. Your co-workers will always help you out if you aren't trying to cover up imperfections.\r\n\r\n- \"Can't draw. [...]\"\r\nDo people who suck at math feel bad about using calculators? I guess they could get worked up over it, but why? When doing artsy stuff, find tools that compensate for your blind spots / skill gaps. Think of how many talented artists couldn't use watercolor to save their life. The issue with lines? Draw them in MSPaint with the line tool so you can't mess up, print it, and work from that? As for perspective, why not look for plugins that can resize a selected area *relative* to another? I don't have good answers here, but I've got to believe there's a workaround for being frustrum-impaired :). Take a step back from trying to draw, and instead spend some time looking for affordable, sensible tools that might help you.\r\n\r\n- \"I'm not at all creative or imaginative anymore. [...] playing Minecraft [...]\"\r\nCreativity waxes and wanes directly in proportion with your available energy and level of boredom. As a developer who is trying to draw and create their own virtual game worlds, your mind is literally never experiencing a break. You can deal with this in one of two ways that I'm aware of -- either by A) *scheduling* break periods into your life to let your mind wander, or by B) finding a philosophical place of contentment where creativity isn't a metric you use to judge yourself. Also, stop playing Minecraft. You can't be inspired by playing with blocks as an adult, unless your IQ is less than that of a block. If you're actively looking for inspiration from video game media, try a story driven game with adult narratives, a low-pressure music-driven game, or something experimental.

[...] loop through DOM elements [...]\"\nDon't drink from the firehose :). Poorly designed languages and bad APIs are NOT your fault. The current state of software development is garbage. I feel awful for Gen Z / the newer folks getting into it. You are sold a sterilized view of what serious programming is about, but most software is a hot mess. Take a break from producing code for other people. If that means skipping assignments/work/etc, do it. In my case, I saved what little desire I had left to code by writing an emulator front-end. It was totally superfluous, but it worked exactly the way I wanted it to, and it was fun to make. YOU NEED SIMILAR PROJECTS. Small ones that only you care about. Programming, in terms of a career/hobby, is a marathon - not a sprint. Don't let agile warriors fool you :). Fuck the latest JavaScript API. You will learn it when you need it and then forget it. Just make sure you actually know how to write loops as a matter of principle - basic logical competencies of the field - and learn your limitations. Your co-workers will always help you out if you aren't trying to cover up imperfections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Can't draw. [...]\"\nDo people who suck at math feel bad about using calculators? I guess they could get worked up over it, but why? When doing artsy stuff, find tools that compensate for your blind spots / skill gaps. Think of how many talented artists couldn't use watercolor to save their life. The issue with lines? Draw them in MSPaint with the line tool so you can't mess up, print it, and work from that? As for perspective, why not look for plugins that can resize a selected area <em>relative</em> to another? I don't have good answers here, but I've got to believe there's a workaround for being frustrum-impaired :). Take a step back from trying to draw, and instead spend some time looking for affordable, sensible tools that might help you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"I'm not at all creative or imaginative anymore. [...] playing Minecraft [...]\"\nCreativity waxes and wanes directly in proportion with your available energy and level of boredom. As a developer who is trying to draw and create their own virtual game worlds, your mind is literally never experiencing a break. You can deal with this in one of two ways that I'm aware of -- either by A) <em>scheduling</em> break periods into your life to let your mind wander, or by B) finding a philosophical place of contentment where creativity isn't a metric you use to judge yourself.
