I actually like how it's not restrictive and you can do a lot of things that make perfect sense but other languages don't let you. I also like how you have access to the actual machine as opposed to being locked into an interpreter or VM for another piece of software, though that's definitely not necessary for a lot of programs. Basically, it feels like there's not much you can't do in it, whereas in a good bit of other languages there's a lot of things you can't do. Certain things may be easier or more highly optimized for other languages, and in that case it makes sense (ofc reddit and ruqqus aren't written in C++, python/C#/PHP are much better suited for webdev).

I actually like how it's not restrictive and you can do a lot of things that make perfect sense but other languages don't let you. I also like how you have access to the actual machine as opposed to being locked into an interpreter or VM for another piece of software, though that's definitely not necessary for a lot of programs. Basically, it feels like there's not much you can't do in it, whereas in a good bit of other languages there's a lot of things you can't do. Certain things may be easier or more highly optimized for other languages, and in that case it makes sense (ofc reddit and ruqqus aren't written in C++, python/C#/PHP are much better suited for webdev).

Most libraries these days are already cross-platform, so there's only a few edge cases where you need to use platform-specific code.

Quite the opposite, in fact, as python expands and gets into microcontrollers, web development etc. The day when it replaces JS in browser will be the happiest day of my life.</p>\n","created_utc":1598901827,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_9usb","guild_id":"3i","herald_guild":null,"id":"9usb","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["9upw"],"permalink":"/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9usb","post_id":"2u8f","score":5,"upvotes":5,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["9usb"],"permalink":"/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9veo","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"I am not even close to a good developer, and C++ is my main language.

Plenty of C++ compilers yield different results for the same code. See [here](https://is.muni.cz/th/webh9/thesis.pdf). Javascript is formally defined, and V8, the most prevalent runtime, is extremely consistent. See [here](https://daejunpark.github.io/p346-park.pdf). The ability to live up to spec is comparable, although JS interpreters are not quite as consistent.\r\n\r\nWe’re talking about extreeeeeeme edge cases, though. If you write a for loop in js, it acts like a for loop, just like it does in C++. You only get into compiler or runtime inconsistencies with very atypical, often extremely unexpected abuses of the language. That applies to both C++ and js. Your seeming claim that you can’t rely on keywords to act as keywords in js is retarded.\r\n\r\nSecond, your claim that “everything” is harder and will take “10 years to do in JS” is patently untrue. I’ve used both plenty. I agree C++ isn’t that bad, but you’re painting js as insanely more complicated, which makes zero fucking sense. I was curious what you’d come up with/thought you might have a credible take here (C++ has its place/is more appropriate for a lot of things, for sure), but I’ve never heard anyone try to claim the syntax for js was super confusing or complicated, especially compared to C++. No one I know, including myself, finds basic js syntax harder than C++. Javascript is a c family language for fucks sake. A lot of the syntax is inherited from c. It’s not like some weird different kind of thing like Haskell.\r\n\r\nWhat I suspect is going on here is you’ve dealt with crappy spaghetti code JS (plenty of which exists, likely more so than in any other language; you could argue JS makes it easy to write crappy code, in part because its easy for novices to build up and you’re using it in the context of browser crap), and have attributed that difficulty to the language itself.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to be clear, I’m not a JS fanboy. There’s plenty to complain about with JS. It has a lot of problems. But most of those relate to how it doesn’t have types and can encourage designs that lead to long term maintainability issues/how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with it, and the chaotic ecosystem/crappy libraries.

See <a href=\"https://daejunpark.github.io/p346-park.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The ability to live up to spec is comparable, although JS interpreters are not quite as consistent.</p>\n<p>We’re talking about extreeeeeeme edge cases, though. If you write a for loop in js, it acts like a for loop, just like it does in C++. You only get into compiler or runtime inconsistencies with very atypical, often extremely unexpected abuses of the language. That applies to both C++ and js. Your seeming claim that you can’t rely on keywords to act as keywords in js is retarded.</p>\n<p>Second, your claim that “everything” is harder and will take “10 years to do in JS” is patently untrue. I’ve used both plenty. I agree C++ isn’t that bad, but you’re painting js as insanely more complicated, which makes zero fucking sense. I was curious what you’d come up with/thought you might have a credible take here (C++ has its place/is more appropriate for a lot of things, for sure), but I’ve never heard anyone try to claim the syntax for js was super confusing or complicated, especially compared to C++. No one I know, including myself, finds basic js syntax harder than C++. Javascript is a c family language for fucks sake. A lot of the syntax is inherited from c. It’s not like some weird different kind of thing like Haskell.</p>\n<p>What I suspect is going on here is you’ve dealt with crappy spaghetti code JS (plenty of which exists, likely more so than in any other language; you could argue JS makes it easy to write crappy code, in part because its easy for novices to build up and you’re using it in the context of browser crap), and have attributed that difficulty to the language itself.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I’m not a JS fanboy. There’s plenty to complain about with JS. It has a lot of problems. But most of those relate to how it doesn’t have types and can encourage designs that lead to long term maintainability issues/how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with it, and the chaotic ecosystem/crappy libraries. The language itself isn’t the crapshoot, difficult to write simple things with, pray it works thing you’re describing.</p>\n","created_utc":1598911565,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":1598913237,"fullname":"t3_9vl0","guild_id":"3i","herald_guild":null,"id":"9vl0","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["9vgl"],"permalink":"/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9vl0","post_id":"2u8f","score":5,"upvotes":6,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["9vl0"],"permalink":"/+Programming/post/2u8f/why-do-people-think-c-and/9vvn","post":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"I am not even close to a good developer, and C++ is my main language.

JavaScript uses a different programming paradigm, and if you approach it the same way you approach C, you're gonna have a bad time.  Neither approach is better than the other, they're just different and have their own strengths and weaknesses.  If you want to git gud in JavaScript (and unfortunately you have to if you want to do anything on the web), here are some suggestions to help understand the JavaScript mindset.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it's impossible to run a syntactically incorrect program in a compiled language like C - the compiler stops you and tells you what you've done wrong. JavaScript doesn't care what you've written until that line of code gets executed. This makes it easy to do something stupid like misspelling a variable. A good IDE helps you avoid errors like this. [\"use strict\"](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp) is great for this too. Make sure you know how to use the Chrome or Firefox dev tools as well - monitor the console for errors, set breakpoints and step through code. \r\n\r\nNext, JavaScript is event-driven, not a procedural language. This is a powerful feature that allows it to do stuff like respond to used clicks and inputs, or change content after a web API call returns. The program does not need to block waiting for input or slow web connection responses. Try writing an event driven C program - an Arduino that responds to button presses, or a console program that listens for keyboard events - this will help you understand what if going on with JavaScript under the hood. The language is just hiding the `while (true)` \"event loop\" in the interpreter's code.\r\n\r\nLastly, you're right, DOM manipulation is a huge pain. That said, it is just as painful to manipulate HTML (or more commonly XML) in C. There are loads of libraries and frameworks out there that make it much easier. Something like jQuery if you want to stick to fairly basic JavaScript, or a single-page-app framework like Vue, Angular, or React if you're writing a heavy duty app. \r\n\r\nIf you're coming to a new language you're going to have to invest some time in understanding how the language works and why.  Similarly, a JavaScript developer is going to be completely confused the first time they try to write C and have to figure out how to use pointers and references.","body_html":"<p>Ok, if you come from a C background, I understand a lot of the JavaScript hate.

Something like jQuery if you want to stick to fairly basic JavaScript, or a single-page-app framework like Vue, Angular, or React if you're writing a heavy duty app.</p>\n<p>If you're coming to a new language you're going to have to invest some time in understanding how the language works and why.  Similarly, a JavaScript developer is going to be completely confused the first time they try to write C and have to figure out how to use pointers and references.</p>\n","created_utc":1598930672,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1598930895,"fullname":"t3_9wvf","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/programming/banner-17.png","color":"#044966","created_utc":1582928650,"description":"Back-end to front-end.\n\n---\nRelated guilds:\n\n+Webdev\n\n+Privacy\n\n+MachineLearning\n\n+Productivity\n\n+OpenSource","description_html":"<p>Back-end to front-end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Related guilds:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Webdev\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Webdev/pic/profile\"/>+Webdev</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Privacy\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Privacy/pic/profile\"/>+Privacy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+MachineLearning\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+MachineLearning/pic/profile\"/>+MachineLearning</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+Productivity\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Productivity/pic/profile\"/>+Productivity</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/+OpenSource\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+OpenSource/pic/profile\"/>+OpenSource</a></p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_3i","id":"3i","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Programming","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Programming","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/programming/profile-10.png"},"guild_id":"3i","herald_guild":null,"id":"9wvf","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":5,"parent":{"author_name":"CrystalVulpine","award_count":0,"body":"> Plenty of C++ compilers yield different results for the same code.\r\n\r\nThis is true, but in general they behave as they say they will.
