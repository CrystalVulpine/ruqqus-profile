I noticed that just a picture of a fox does not get much attention; only if the picture is outstanding or uncommon in some way it will receive significant upvotes. So a fox stealing a carrot from a snowman will receive more rep than a generic image of a fox that's just walking. A picture of a grey fox sleeping on someone's car is more upvote-worthy than a fox sleeping in a forest somewhere, because it isn't common.</p>\n<p>That's the main reason, but another important factor is probably just luck.</p>\n","created_utc":1599149883,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_a6qt","guild_id":"rt","herald_guild":null,"id":"a6qt","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent_comment_id":["a47r"],"permalink":"/+foxes/post/2wsv/i-love-winter-its-just-free/a6qt","post_id":"2wsv","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["a6qt"],"permalink":"/+foxes/post/2wsv/i-love-winter-its-just-free/a710","post":{"author_name":"foxite","award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":8,"created_utc":1599078363,"domain":"i.ruqqus.com","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_2wsv","guild_id":"rt","guild_name":"foxes","herald_guild":null,"id":"2wsv","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+foxes/post/2wsv/i-love-winter-its-just-free","score":2,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/2wsv/thumb.png","title":"\"I love winter, it's just free carrots in every garden.\"","upvotes":2,"url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/2wsv/IiSnE7szVGE"},"post_id":"2wsv","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
