I've seen a lot of people who will do some unnecessary complicated way of achieving something that's obviously best implemented procedurally and/or with raw constructs like arrays and pointers, and they'll refuse to do that *just* to avoid \"C code\". They act like C++ is a completely different and unrelated language to C, and that C is evil and to be avoided at all costs (There is also the flip side, C programmers who hate anything associated with C++). They end up shooting themselves in the foot wasting time creating some insane mechanism to do a task that's very simple to achieve with C-like methods, and then they get slow programs as a result.
