And I'm pretty sure Hawkins isn't the most libertarian candidate either.</p>\n<p>So I decided to re-make the chart with the goal of having more honest positions for the major candidates:</p>\n<p><a data-target=\"#expandImageModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/3bcx/-daRA6JfQ90\" onclick=\"expandDesktopImage('https://i.ruqqus.com/post/3bcx/-daRA6JfQ90');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"in-comment-image rounded-sm my-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" src=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/3bcx/-daRA6JfQ90\" style=\"max-height: 100px; max-width: 100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p>For the major candidates, we actually have a fairly normal year sparing Biden's dementia. Biden and Harris occupy the more authoritarian positions to the left of the American center. Biden is a bit more authoritarian than most Democrats: he supports all of the normal Democratic ideas, such as banning guns and regulating free speech, but is also found in support of some traditionally conservative positions, such as criminalizing drugs.</p>\n<p>Despite constant media polarization, Trump is slightly more libertarian than normal, but otherwise in the average position for a Republican (in 2016 he was further left, but has since shifted rightward). He generally sides with the live and let live approach to Americans' lives. Some decisions, such as the legalization of drugs, he has left to the states. But for someone who also supports the death penalty, waterboarding, doing away with immigration, and regulating free speech with regards to the flag or Israel, he's not exactly anti-authoritarian either. Mike Pence might be more of a cause for concern, as he seems to have \"old conservative Democrat\" syndrome and very authoritarian tendencies.</p>\n<p>Some may be surprised to see Bernie Sanders placed in the lib side of the axis. However, he is not as tightly-knitted as the other Democrats and is willing to think for himself, even as insane as his ideas may be. I will point out that until recently, for example, he opposed gun control legislation. He is certainly an outlier to the party and unlike most of the other candidates. While most Democrats push towards \"making a change\" and progressive ideals, Bernie's extremism is on the economic axis, not the auth/lib axis (note that any position on the left side of the compass leans towards socialism, which is an extreme position despite encompassing a wide range of ideas).</p>\n<p>Jo Jorgensen is a pretty standard libertarian, but a few things shift her more towards the authoritarian side of the compass. She supports legislation banning the confederate flag on public property, overriding states' decisions on the matter and therefore free speech. She also supports expanding anti-discrimination laws which would force religious business owners to act against their beliefs. She has espoused some SJW tendencies on twitter and supported movements such as BLM and Antifa, which is quite interesting for someone with libertarian beliefs.</p>\n<p>Howie Hawkins, the Green and Socialist party candidate, is about where you'd expect economically. He also undoubtedly pushes progressivism, landing him at about the same place as Biden and Harris on the auth axis.</p>\n","comment_count":2,"created_utc":1600359362,"domain":"i.ruqqus.com","downvotes":5,"edited_utc":1600359411,"fullname":"t2_3bcx","guild_id":"1r3","guild_name":"PoliticalCompass","herald_guild":null,"id":"3bcx","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+PoliticalCompass/post/3bcx/hopefully-this-is-more-accurate","score":11,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/3bcx/thumb.png","title":"Hopefully this is more accurate","upvotes":16,"url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/3bcx/-daRA6JfQ90"},"post_id":"3bcx","score":3,"upvotes":4,"voted":0}
