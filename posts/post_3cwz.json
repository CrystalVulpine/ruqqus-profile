Or maybe they have, and given how easy it is for the media to completely manipulate how a large portion of the public sees a person, they have and they\u2019ve been downtrodden.

Betting odds are currently 53% Biden 46% Trump.\n\nI'd say the election is competitive and unlikely to be a landslide, but I'm pretty skeptical of people I hear putting Trump's odds above 50%.  The RCP average has Biden up a [whopping 6.2%](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html).  While the election is of course not decided by a popular vote (and Trump actually lost the popular vote by about 2%) we know that there's a limit to how much the the electoral college and popular vote can realistically diverge.  I have a lot of trouble believing in a Trump victory from more than 3% behind in the popular vote.  The state level polling honestly feels shockingly non-robust to me, but it's enough to suspect Trump has real problems; the [no-toss up RCP map](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/2020_elections_electoral_college_map_no_toss_ups.html) would currently show Biden with 353 electoral votes and Trump with 185.  Now with the way swing states work this can still be very volatile and look very different if the national mood shifts by a few percentage points overall.  We should not view each state as an independent contest, as they often tend to move together in regions or nationally, which was probably a lot of why so many models in 2016 thought it was such a sure thing for Clinton.  Underestimating systemic error and all of that, especially in the somewhat underpolled Midwest region, where Trump carried a lot of states by small margins.\n\nI do want to point out why I'm not a believer in the \"shy Trump voter\"/polls understate Trump's support argument.  If you look at 2016 on a national level, the [RCP average](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) was quite good, only off by about 1 percentage point.  Even at the state level it really wasn't all that bad all things considered, with maybe a big exception for [Wisconsin](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5976.html) where the polls were somehow wrong by an embarrassing 7 points, well outside margins of error.  I might blame plain old underpolling here and claim they might have missed a last minute surge by not polling often enough, although I'll admit the sheer scale of this one is a bit hard to explain away.  This state seems to be the exception more than the rule though, with others tending to be all off in the same direction of underestimating Trump, but usually by a much more modest number of points consistent with some late deciders going his way.  This may or may not happen again and should be kept in mind, but overall I think the national margin is too big and too consistent over time to be a mirage.\n\nHonestly looking at the evidence, I personally have trouble seeing how the betting odds are what they are.  I feel enthusiasm should matter less in this election because people are going to be voting over such long periods of time; also, because voting is starting so early, there is much less opportunity for the underdog to come back than in a usual election cycle.  My assumption is that this will be the highest turnout election in history because of how long the voting period is and how much effort there will be on both sides to get out the vote.
