But how do you find threads from years ago? For example, you were wondering about what happens to /r/u_ subreddits like /r/u_irl. How did you manage to look up that thread from 3 years ago? There's no way you can really search for that so how did you find the post about it so easily?</p>\n<p>And how do you do all that programming stuff? You know how to use pushshift directly, everything about reddit's api, how to make a formatting language in CSS, and can spot obscure bugs just by skimming through code. You say you're not really a programmer but I am (or am supposed to be) and can't do any of that stuff without help (and \"help\" just means someone else does it all for me). In fact even now I can't figure out the color code bug knowing it exists, for example.</p>\n<p>The other thing is how you're always able to spot available names that should've been taken years ago. I know /r/srname was just luck but you do it all the time. The only thing I ever got was /r/CuteMemes. Even on Ruqqus 99% of the generic names are already taken, but when you try it (ex. <a href=\"/+Private\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Private/pic/profile\"/>+Private</a>) it's always available.</p>\n<p>Also how do you have comments in /r/srname that don't show up on your overview page?</p>\n<p>Also what does <code>(whatever)</code> mean in CSS? I can't find it anywhere, so what does it mean? And how did you learn about it?</p>\n<p>And where did you find out about /r/123456? And how did you know the creation date? <del>The API I'm guessing?</del> EDIT: No, it couldn't have been the API page, because that only shows the approximate date string, and the actual timestamp is not included anywhere. So how were you able to get the exact timestamp for it (and /r/Thank_China)? And however you do it, how did you learn about it?</p>\n<p>As for the API, how did you find out about that <code>/api/info?id=</code> url? And how did you know you could get the info on the reddit website by typing it into a web browser?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1604942299, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1604968413, "fullname": "t3_gcpr", "guild_id": "2", "herald_guild": null, "id": "gcpr", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 38, "parent_comment_id": ["gax2"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/3el0/sorry-if-i-missed-it-did/gcpr", "post_id": "3el0", "score": 2, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["gcpr"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/3el0/sorry-if-i-missed-it-did/gw5b", "post": {"author_name": null, "award_count": 0, "body": "I haven't been following along for a bit but I wanted to know what happened.
