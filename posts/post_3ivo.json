About every few months I do a search for conservative news outlets or aggregators. \r\n\r\nThen I see what my conservative political commentators are talking about etc. Usually a wrap or further discussion of stuff that happened earlier in the week. Good for people who aren’t active in seeing this news.

Some days I watch/listen more and some days I don’t. Depends on my mood. \r\n\r\nNow digesting that’s info is another component. Dealing with fake news. Discerning truth means finding sources. Since I am aware of the general political landscape. I know when people say “Trump said this”, I can check the White House for videos of him at events (and probably I already watched). Which means I’ll know if he said and if it’s consistent with his daily character. If it’s about an incident, I may have already heard about it from the anons. While I don’t have Twitter, I can still search it. I will search with hashtags. Or you can use reverse image lookup for original sources. When people talk about a document, I’ll go find it. Sometimes I just copy and paste quotes into search to see where else they pop up. If it’s like an incident, I’ll search YouTube for videos of it or Bitchute. \r\n\r\nBut as you can see I have a wholistic net that covers things for different angles and different entities connect. You absorb certain meta information by engaging with it. \r\n\r\nI used to have other methods as well. I used to be on the_donald on reddit, I used to be an active and regular member of that discord as well and people would drop info and other discords. But as I’ve gotten more independent in sourcing my info, I don’t need some of them. Sometimes getting cut off from sources means finding new ways to find information because you are forced to. \r\n\r\nOther days I pivot into active exploring. This where I explore the edges of what I know and further my knowledge in general or fix gaps in my information net, like finding more conservative women perspectives. This is also conspiracy related content and political, philosophical, theological theory. \r\n\r\nAnd some days I focus more on non-political content. \r\n\r\nThoughts, questions?","body_html":"<p>So maybe it’ll help if I add this concept.
