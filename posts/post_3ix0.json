Sit in a cubical all day.  Pay is good.  Everyone at every level of employment has issues and stuff to complain about, but this has been a good life. You can find work anywhere, even at the bottom of a recession.  I highly recommend it if you can get the work. You need a degree for a lot of jobs. Your first job gets you your second. And there's an unlimited amount of work, we love more workers. There's so much god-damned stuff to do.     Well, competent ones. Shitty programmers just make more work for the rest of us. \r\n\r\nHonestly, engineering is just more paperwork.
