That is of course an oversimplification, but fairly accurate. The further left you go on the color picker, the more grey looking your color will be. At the very top of the color picker, the further you go left, the more white it will look. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6DVlpxX.png\r\n\r\n**How this can be used for a triangle compass**\r\n\r\nThe middle triangle, in my triangle compass template, had zero saturation and some brightness.

When it was closer to the edge of the triangle, I made it have a lot of saturation. The outside of the triangle was essentially gradients between pure LibRight, pure AuthLeft, and pure AuthRight. The inside was those same gradients, but with much less saturation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>This is a common theme in my life. Whenever I try to do something, it's an embarrassing mess and obvious that I just threw it together. Whenever anyone else tries to do something, it's 100% perfect and could be used in a professional industry environment, usually with less effort and time than my crap took.\r\n\r\nDon't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you're skilled in something. List some of your hobbies, and I guarantee you I'm terrible at them and you're better than me. You showed me some stuff you did in Photoshop, and it looks better than anything I ever made in GIMP.\r\n\r\nAnd this isn't very relevant, but I'm also terrible at any action video games I play, but I don't let that ruin my enjoyment of them. That also doesn't define my video game experience, I would consider myself extremely good at Run 3 (A flash platforming game, but still very fun.
