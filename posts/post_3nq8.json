Guilds that aren\u2019t political at all are getting tons of political posts in there and it\u2019s getting to the point where I feel like my experience of this site is being downgraded just from this alone.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sensitive. I can take shit. It\u2019s just that I ordered a \u201cpasta and meatballs\u201d dish and got a gigantic tub of pasta (with a shitload of spicy sauce on it) and only one or two meatballs, and I\u2019m not going to make myself fat by eating the entire thing.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m taking a break for a week and then I\u2019ll continue to unsub the repeat offender guilds. I don\u2019t care what anyone says so you know what? You don\u2019t have to care what I say either. Go ahead! Comment about how I need to \u201cgo back to reddit\u201d or how you \u201cskipped the entire post\u201d or how my opinion is \u201cwrong\u201d, I won\u2019t reply or even notice.
