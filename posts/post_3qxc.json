The whole movie centers on Anakin’s transformation, which happens for virtually no reason. It’s ham fisted garbage. Palpatine doesn’t seduce Anakin, he just straight up tells him to murder everyone for this vague reassurance that this dream he has won’t happen and he does it.\r\n\r\nHe speaks and acts like a complete retard, not some tragic love struck fallen hero. I get what George Lucas was going for, it just fails on virtually every level. Even the fight scene, which is the one thing I was looking forward to in that movie, was over the top and absurd. It’s so choreographed and unnatural. It felt way too forced, like some sort of dumb 10 year old’s fan fiction.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s still the best part of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is incredibly bad, I really don’t understand people who think it’s ok, let alone one of the better star wars movies.\r\n\r\nTFA was boring, but it set up some potentially cool plot lines. It wasn’t completely nonsensical, although it had stupid parts (attacking starkiller base at the last minute based on some vague assertions from a janitor is retarded, unlike the highly planned and well justified attack based on stolen plans which took a lot of effort for A New Hope). TLJ completely and utterly dropped the ball, but it set up potential for the Disney stuff (snoke could have been cool, expanding on why the resistance was a thing/what the hell was going on in the star wars universe where the first order was able to come back could have bern interesting, explaining what the hell happened with Luke might have been cool, but it was all ruined).

I get what George Lucas was going for, it just fails on virtually every level. Even the fight scene, which is the one thing I was looking forward to in that movie, was over the top and absurd.
