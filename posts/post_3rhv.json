Humanity hasn't been anywhere near as corrupt as before the flood ever since then, aside from a few specific instances. When's the last time a civilization was destroyed for that?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Likewise then immediately after the flood, most people were \"good,\" then over time things got worse again</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, because \"everyone\" here is Noah and his family.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there were many \"good\" people, and over time it got worse again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't see how it's gotten worse. Outside of a few third-world countries, when is the last time people were burned alive on the streets and thrown in arenas to be ripped to shreds by wild animals, enjoyed by a sadistic audience of everyday people? Do people still have slaves that they rape and kill regularly (and even women and children)? This is how the most \"civilized\" people used to act, not just a few antifa looters here and there. Times are certainly not perfect now, but I don't know how you could think that they were better before.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to include greece, rome, and now the US, among others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greece and Rome were strongest when they deluded themselves and had no morals. When Christianity spread in Rome, morality increased and prevented them from doing many of the immoral things necessary to maintain such an empire. In fact, aside from having to be brutal, such faith in the \"greatness\" of their empires is pride and idolatry.
