First, the Early Christian Church. Back in the day, before the actual Catholics, the Church was very fractured. Almost all of its converts were pagans (Romans) Or ... Jews. Most of the Bible is based in the Torah and other Jewish writings, and as many of it's converts were Jews first, it follows that a great many early Christian \"traditions\" were based in Jewish traditions and faith. Terrified that the new Christian faith would become nothing but a Jewish off-shoot religion with Jewish traditions, the early Church demonized anything Jewish. They started the prejudice using the \"The Jews killed Jesus\" theme, changed the Sabbath to Sunday (not Saturday) and encouraged the new Christians to not only reject anything Jewish related, but Jews themselves. Like any Cult in its early days, they wanted new converts to leave their Family (parents, siblings, spouses) and only associate with those of the cult. Hypocritically, they kept the Old Testament because...cool stories. \r\n\r\nThe later Christians and by later I mean the First Crusade, demonized not only Jews but Muslims in an effort to completely eradicate any religion that wasn't the Catholic Church, and of course, take over the Holy Land as the domain of only the Catholic faith--they considered it their birthright due to Christ (Jerusalem) and therefore, anything non Catholic---especially Jews--was in the way of that Crusade to take the Holy Land. \r\n\r\nBut the final nail was the King of France in the 1300's and the fact that Jews owned the only banks at the time. The King owed his Jewish bankers a shit ton of money. A shit ton. He didn't want to pay it. By the time the Black Death hit, the Jews (who were a clear minority) were the easy scapegoats, and got the King out of his obligation. So he simply decided to demonize all the Jews in France, blame them for everything including the plague, spread rumors that they were eating babies and drinking blood. And Bam! He could expel all the Jews from France. No more Jewish banks, therefore.... no more debt to pay. \r\n\r\nAnd that's about the sum of it. Anyone who hates Jews now is actually basing all that hatred on A) the Catholic Church and it's early fears of being a Jewish offshoot religiously, B) the Crusades to take Jerusalem, and C) a bunch of superstitious hokum by incredibly uneducated peasants in the 1300's based on rumors spread by a King who was a dead beat who didn't want to pay his bills.

Anyone who hates Jews now is actually basing all that hatred on A) the Catholic Church and it's early fears of being a Jewish offshoot religiously, B) the Crusades to take Jerusalem, and C) a bunch of superstitious hokum by incredibly uneducated peasants in the 1300's based on rumors spread by a King who was a dead beat who didn't want to pay his bills. That's it. Which means the idiots would probably believe the Earth is flat, too, and \"bad humors\" cause disease and menstrual blood is \"unclean\" or some other plague era--illiterate nonsense.","body_html":"<p>Because I'm a nerd, and I'm on the net a lot, I hear a lot of antisemitism and one day I wondered, Where the fuck is this dumb shit coming from? I need to know. I went down a few rabbit holes I never want to see again, and then I actually did serious research on the claims of the rabbits who created those black holes. This took probably 6 months, tbh, because I'm an idiot who wastes their time on this kind of intellectual pursuit with no end result but the satisfaction of my curiosity.</p>\n<p>What I found is that the hate of Jews really is irrational, but it does have a root cause. First, the Early Christian Church. Back in the day, before the actual Catholics, the Church was very fractured. Almost all of its converts were pagans (Romans) Or ... Jews. Most of the Bible is based in the Torah and other Jewish writings, and as many of it's converts were Jews first, it follows that a great many early Christian \"traditions\" were based in Jewish traditions and faith. Terrified that the new Christian faith would become nothing but a Jewish off-shoot religion with Jewish traditions, the early Church demonized anything Jewish. They started the prejudice using the \"The Jews killed Jesus\" theme, changed the Sabbath to Sunday (not Saturday) and encouraged the new Christians to not only reject anything Jewish related, but Jews themselves. Like any Cult in its early days, they wanted new converts to leave their Family (parents, siblings, spouses) and only associate with those of the cult. Hypocritically, they kept the Old Testament because...cool stories.</p>\n<p>The later Christians and by later I mean the First Crusade, demonized not only Jews but Muslims in an effort to completely eradicate any religion that wasn't the Catholic Church, and of course, take over the Holy Land as the domain of only the Catholic faith--they considered it their birthright due to Christ (Jerusalem) and therefore, anything non Catholic---especially Jews--was in the way of that Crusade to take the Holy Land.</p>\n<p>But the final nail was the King of France in the 1300's and the fact that Jews owned the only banks at the time. The King owed his Jewish bankers a shit ton of money. A shit ton. He didn't want to pay it. By the time the Black Death hit, the Jews (who were a clear minority) were the easy scapegoats, and got the King out of his obligation. So he simply decided to demonize all the Jews in France, blame them for everything including the plague, spread rumors that they were eating babies and drinking blood. And Bam! He could expel all the Jews from France. No more Jewish banks, therefore.... no more debt to pay.</p>\n<p>And that's about the sum of it. Anyone who hates Jews now is actually basing all that hatred on A) the Catholic Church and it's early fears of being a Jewish offshoot religiously, B) the Crusades to take Jerusalem, and C) a bunch of superstitious hokum by incredibly uneducated peasants in the 1300's based on rumors spread by a King who was a dead beat who didn't want to pay his bills. That's it.

First, the Early Christian Church. Back in the day, before the actual Catholics, the Church was very fractured. Almost all of its converts were pagans (Romans) Or ... Jews.

Terrified that the new Christian faith would become nothing but a Jewish off-shoot religion with Jewish traditions, the early Church demonized anything Jewish. They started the prejudice using the \"The Jews killed Jesus\" theme, changed the Sabbath to Sunday (not Saturday) and encouraged the new Christians to not only reject anything Jewish related, but Jews themselves.
