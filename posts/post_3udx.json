During the 2016 election, Trump promised to repeal NCLB and eliminate or reduce federally mandated standardized testing (which I believe he did). That was the last I heard about it, until now when it's apparently back to being a Republican cause.</p>\n","created_utc":1602158654,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_d9qb","guild_id":"3v","herald_guild":null,"id":"d9qb","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":4,"parent_comment_id":["d8sl"],"permalink":"/+Politics/post/3udx/an-alarming-1-in-5-universities/d9qb","post_id":"3udx","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["d9qb"],"permalink":"/+Politics/post/3udx/an-alarming-1-in-5-universities/d9zz","post":{"author_name":"NewsJunkie","award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":29,"created_utc":1602092340,"domain":"thedailyfodder.com","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_3udx","guild_id":"3v","guild_name":"Politics","herald_guild":null,"id":"3udx","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Politics/post/3udx/an-alarming-1-in-5-universities","score":62,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/3udx/thumb.png","title":"An Alarming 1 in 5 Universities Will Fail Due To Lockdowns","upvotes":63,"url":"https://www.thedailyfodder.com/2020/10/nyu-prof-more-than-20-percent-of.html?utm_source=ruqqus&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialshare"},"post_id":"3udx","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":0}
