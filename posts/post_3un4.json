You guessed it! Most of these were appointed before becoming discord mods...so it proves that the admins were already biased towards them when they were added. The admins are also very exclusive about who's allowed to GM stuff with them, but it took zero effort for the current ones to be invited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whenever anyone else creates a meta-guild, the admins make sure to brush it off because they're not good enough for that in their eyes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins pretty much create whatever channels the mods want in the discord server</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins always make sure to award earned roles to mods and soon-to-be-mods in the discord server, but others rarely get them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They give the mods more than just moderating privileges on the discord, including: the right to see deleted channels, the right to send messages in channels without earning the required roles, the right to see deleted and even edit versions of messages (security risk), access to private logs detailing the admins' actions, a private chat with the admins where they are told about things the rest of us aren't, the right to bypass slowmode filters, banned words, etc, and I'm sure a lot more stuff. This is intentional, and they see it fit because the mods apparently deserve more than others because of their status.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The admins become <em>extremely angry and defensive</em> when you dare criticize this holy caste system of theirs. And I mean they get fucking triggered, at least cap and ark. They even removed the reddit nazi reaction from the server because I used it to call them out on this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "created_utc": 1602175391, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_dafp", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1575480088, "description": "The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcbb No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udfea Ruqqus-related only.
