They both have their place in my life and often times intermingle in ways that are hard to describe without a great deal of reflection, eloquence and time. \n\nFor example, I thank God for the existence of video games and consider it miraculous how we can make worlds within worlds with pixels and code, but that does not mean I disregard how it is they are able to function and exist in the first place.

I'd love to see what else is out there, ya know? I do not see how that hurts me or progress, not that I'm saying you are saying as such to anyone here, but there are those that have found my faith revolting when awestruck by these wonders as if I were saying His existence negates the physical plane of existence when I think we should strive to understand both the physical and metaphysical (if the field isn't allowed to be dominated by snake oil salesmen.) The point is though, I believe many educated and modern Christians feel the same way. We attribute the wonders of this world to God and find ourselves in awe of how they work, but it does not mean we disrespect the physical plane and the laws it currently abides by.

Then again, I may be a bit biased towards Creationists for their regular attempts at dismantling our curriculum years back.

I do not see how that hurts me or progress, not that I'm saying you are saying as such to anyone here, but there are those that have found my faith revolting when awestruck by these wonders as if I were saying His existence negates the physical plane of existence when I think we should strive to understand both the physical and metaphysical (if the field isn't allowed to be dominated by snake oil salesmen.) The point is though, I believe many educated and modern Christians feel the same way. We attribute the wonders of this world to God and find ourselves in awe of how they work, but it does not mean we disrespect the physical plane and the laws it currently abides by. If anything, many Christians want to see science progress far enough that maybe everyone else will see what we do.</p>\n<p>Of course, I do agree that there are Christians and other religious groups who do stand in the way of progress all because they've convinced themselves that revelations like Evolutionism somehow defeat the core tenets and principles of their faith, rather than simply correcting minor details that are mostly irrelevant in the grand scheme of the Christian framework. Then again, I may be a bit biased towards Creationists for their regular attempts at dismantling our curriculum years back. Similar to the Creationist point, I think harping on the minor detail of one's faith can hold back progress as well, especially if the faithful are also willing to seek out answers alongside atheists and agnostics.</p>\n<p>If I may have misunderstood your point on how exactly it gets us nowhere, would you be so kind as to further elaborate on your point for me?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1602294639, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_dfim", "guild_id": "18v", "herald_guild": null, "id": "dfim", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 4, "parent_comment_id": ["deci"], "permalink": "/+DankChristianMemes/post/3vpk/when-you-discuss-your-religious-beliefs/dfim", "post_id": "3vpk", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["dfim"], "permalink": "/+DankChristianMemes/post/3vpk/when-you-discuss-your-religious-beliefs/dflt", "post": {"author_name": null, "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 51, "created_utc": 1602196006, "domain": "i.ruqqus.com", "downvotes": 21, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_3vpk", "guild_id": "18v", "guild_name": "DankChristianMemes", "herald_guild": null, "id": "3vpk", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+DankChristianMemes/post/3vpk/when-you-discuss-your-religious-beliefs", "score": 146, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/3vpk/thumb.png", "title": "When you discuss your religious beliefs on Reddit", "upvotes": 166, "url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/post/3vpk/yQ5lMVRR7jA"}, "post_id": "3vpk", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
