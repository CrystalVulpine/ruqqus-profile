Meanwhile, I will find at the most 2-3 minor things.\r\n\r\nIn +foxes, I could never find enough fox pics because google images sucks. But a lot of other people could always find new *good* ones, while I struggled to even find a new average pic. It turns out they somehow knew of every single source for foxes on the whole internet, and always just so happened to find every tweet, facebook, or instagram post about them too (kind of like the news people).\r\n\r\nOn reddit, user /u/cqtz knows absolutely everything about the site. We're both weird with being interested in bugs and tiny events and shit, but I can never find any information about them. He however, knows just about everything. Check his posts to see what I'm talking about: https://old.reddit.com/user/cqtz\r\n\r\nAnd his documentation at /r/srname: https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/\r\n\r\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/pages\r\n\r\nHe is also super clever and thinks of tricks I'd never consider in a million years. A good example of this is the \"invisible links\", and his text formatting CSS:\r\n\r\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/formatting\r\n\r\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/config/stylesheet\r\n\r\n*And* he always figures out names that should've been taken years ago. A good example is /r/srname, and his 4-letter username (he *still* finds those somehow).\r\n\r\nMinecraft: many of my friends build stuff that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hn6YfuY.jpg)\r\n\r\nMultiple times in the same world; occasionally, in *survival* without cheats. But for me, even in creative I can rarely go past something like this:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wjoX39i.jpg)\r\n\r\nExcept a lot sloppier for me. Sometimes I can go bigger, but not much, and only very slowly, and sloppy.\r\n\r\nAlmost all my friends on ruqqus impress the admins constantly, to the point where they're always being asked to guildmaster official guilds and are mods in the discord server. They don't even have to follow the same rules as everyone else because the admins see them as more \"trustworthy\" and they're told plans and new info about ruqqus before anyone else. There was even a scrapped plan to make them \"junior admins\" on the site! But the admins absolutely fucking *loathe* me, maybe not kek but ark and cap definitely do, especially cap. It was like this from the beginning, before any of us even knew the admins and had just joined this site, so it proves there's something inherent about *me* that's wrong.\r\n\r\nSo you can see how everyone else has all their shit together and everything I do is a mess and an embarrassment. I know all too well that \"positive thinking\" is just a lie to make people like me feel better, and you can't honestly deny that with the evidence at hand.

A good example of this is the \"invisible links\", and his text formatting CSS:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/formatting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/formatting</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/config/stylesheet\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://old.reddit.com/r/srname/wiki/config/stylesheet</a></p>\n<p><em>And</em> he always figures out names that should've been taken years ago. A good example is /r/srname, and his 4-letter username (he <em>still</em> finds those somehow).</p>\n<p>Minecraft: many of my friends build stuff that looks like this:</p>\n<p><a data-target=\"#expandImageModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hn6YfuY.jpg\" onclick=\"expandDesktopImage('https://i.imgur.com/hn6YfuY.jpg');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"in-comment-image rounded-sm my-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hn6YfuY.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 100px; max-width: 100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p>Multiple times in the same world; occasionally, in <em>survival</em> without cheats. But for me, even in creative I can rarely go past something like this:</p>\n<p><a data-target=\"#expandImageModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wjoX39i.jpg\" onclick=\"expandDesktopImage('https://i.imgur.com/wjoX39i.jpg');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"in-comment-image rounded-sm my-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wjoX39i.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 100px; max-width: 100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p>Except a lot sloppier for me. Sometimes I can go bigger, but not much, and only very slowly, and sloppy.</p>\n<p>Almost all my friends on ruqqus impress the admins constantly, to the point where they're always being asked to guildmaster official guilds and are mods in the discord server. They don't even have to follow the same rules as everyone else because the admins see them as more \"trustworthy\" and they're told plans and new info about ruqqus before anyone else. There was even a scrapped plan to make them \"junior admins\" on the site! But the admins absolutely fucking <em>loathe</em> me, maybe not kek but ark and cap definitely do, especially cap. It was like this from the beginning, before any of us even knew the admins and had just joined this site, so it proves there's something inherent about <em>me</em> that's wrong.</p>\n<p>So you can see how everyone else has all their shit together and everything I do is a mess and an embarrassment. I know all too well that \"positive thinking\" is just a lie to make people like me feel better, and you can't honestly deny that with the evidence at hand. I probably am smart compared to most people, but when the average IQ for people you know is like 250, you still feel stupid as fuck.</p>\n","created_utc":1602683480,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1602683507,"fullname":"t3_dsxc","guild_id":"1v","herald_guild":null,"id":"dsxc","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["dssb"],"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/407d/whats-something-most-people-can-do/dsxc","post_id":"407d","score":5,"upvotes":5,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["dsxc"],"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/407d/whats-something-most-people-can-do/dt36","post":{"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"For me, it's the ability to judge distance.
