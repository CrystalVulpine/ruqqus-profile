But you're still asleep. So what happens is you get a dream with an extremely realistic and convincing version of your room, but when you try to move you can now feel that your real body isn't moving, but you don't understand this so as a result you can't move in the dream either. However you can still move the parts of your body that you can in real life, such as fingers, toes, and eye movement. Sometimes I can still roll over, though it's imaginary and when I wake up for real I'm back to where I was initially. There's varying degrees of how much you can feel your real body. You also feel that heavy, lethargic feeling really intense and it feels like you have something pushing on your torso on whatever side is facing up. Sometimes I hear a loud static/radio sound too which I often think is really hard rain at first, I'm not sure why it happens. If you push yourself really hard you can roll out of bed and then you can walk around your fake world, which usually becomes a lot more obvious and different from reality as you leave your initial surroundings. It's hard to get very far without realizing you're dreaming again which usually triggers the \"waking up\" and you're back where you started. This often repeats for me multiple times until I wake up for real or manage to keep dreaming.\r\n\r\nI've always heard about seeing demons and stuff too, but I've never seen anything. Actually, I had been scared to get it before but the first time I got it I was oddly relaxed, no monsters or feelings of presences or being watched. Normally there's no way I'd be willing to explore that dream world because I'm always afraid of what would happen, but when it does happen I'm just not for some reason. I *have* had very similar experiences with false awakenings where I did see scary things, but not when I'm paralyzed. And even those, nothing I saw was ever really \"evil\", it was pretty much just a weird, usually still image of something, usually a deformed person, that looked freaky and made me scared as a result, especially with how real it felt.\r\n\r\nI've only ever had one night terror where I actually felt something legitimately evil or demonic like people say they do in sleep paralysis (maybe even worse), not just your normal haunted house type stuff. However, it was in a normal dream, multiple even, where everyone I saw kept getting this huge impossibly-big grin on their face, and I can't really describe what it was about that face but I knew it was FUCKING demonic. And in the sense of real beings too, not nosleep stories and horror movies and myths about red guys with wings and horns. And it kept following me in every dream I had that night, everyone I interacted with just morphed into that face and I knew it wanted to get me, and I had to run away or worse things than I can possibly imagine would be happen to me forever, that kind of feeling. Even when I woke up, it took a day or two for that feeling of that...thing being out to get me to go away. But it could never get me, for some reason I felt the terror and thought it could but looking back I think in reality it couldn't even touch me. If it was indeed caused by a real demon, which I think is likely considering how my imagination just doesn't go that far any other time, especially since I can't even describe what terrorizes me about that face, I think it may have been trying to trick me into feeling afraid.
