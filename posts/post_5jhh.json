It\u2019s that impulse to find order in a chaotic universe which has lead to the massive, universe encompassing scientific perspective we now hold. The materialist worldview underlying science wouldn\u2019t exist without it.\r\n\r\nWe may differ in what we view as negative, but I believe belittling that impulse to be a negative thing, not a neutral thing.\r\n\r\nIn terms of our own personal relationship to that impulse, I think that recognizing that our actions have lasting consequences that we are capable of understanding, even if they\u2019re only a tiny speck in comparison to the rest of the world and we cannot predict them perfectly, is necessary to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nPeople abandoning all sense of meaning equates to abandoning responsibility for the consequences of their actions. The universe doesn\u2019t demand that responsibility of us, but it also doesn\u2019t prevent or negate it.\r\n\r\nMy point is not that life demands or imposes meaning.
