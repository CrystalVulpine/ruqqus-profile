I was asking if joke submissions were okay since I saw others making them (the purple snoo and the one by milkit).\r\n> \r\n> I've been drawing for over 8 years, which means I do have some experience/practice\r\n\r\nOkay that makes more sense. You're really similar to me and most people on ruqqus are about my age (including the other \"savants\") so I assumed this was just another case of that.\r\n\r\n> There's some misalignment at the bottom, and I also wasn't sure how to get it to be symmetric (I drew the left side first, and I copied and pasted it to make the right side, but I had trouble connecting the two sides together), so it ended up having some asymmetry.\r\n\r\nTrue although the different color shades line up pretty much exactly. Don't know which program you're using but for me all the different colors have to be separate objects, thus they are prone to not aligning with the parent exactly (example: the shading spots under the head and ears). My actual *drawings* aren't bad (aside from the shading, will need some advice on that) but the messiness of my vector components is awful. For example I can drag two curves to be *roughly* the same but not quite, and they're an imperfect shape compared to optimally. Or I can't align different objects exactly, etc. Everything's always just a little off, which would be fine for on paper but vector graphics are meant to be more precise looking and I've never been able to figure out how to do that. And it's also not exactly consistent (ex the tops of the crown are irregularly shaped triangles and also not exactly the same as each other).

Don't know which program you're using but for me all the different colors have to be separate objects, thus they are prone to not aligning with the parent exactly (example: the shading spots under the head and ears). My actual <em>drawings</em> aren't bad (aside from the shading, will need some advice on that) but the messiness of my vector components is awful. For example I can drag two curves to be <em>roughly</em> the same but not quite, and they're an imperfect shape compared to optimally.

I also think that the shading on the left is a bit awkward (it makes the arm seem flat, and the bottom is not connected to the edge of the body), but since I'm not that knowledgeable about shading, I don't really know how to fix it. (If I were to do it, I'd probably end up making the entire left side of the body darker, assuming the light is coming from the top right.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Acikek is similar to sfrohne and is also much younger than I am, yet also does everything consistently and solidly</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I usually feel this way too when seeing someone who's younger and lot more talented than I am. But then I realize that their abilities probably came from a lot of practice and a lot of time spent on learning about the thing they're good at.</p>\n<p>I don't think that it's too good to self-deprecate like this. I think that if you want to improve on drawing, for example, you can try showing one of your drawings to someone who's better at it and ask for advice. You can also try looking up resources on specific things like shading/perspective.</p>\n","created_utc":1607468584,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_j9sk","guild_id":"4ns","herald_guild":null,"id":"j9sk","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":12,"parent_comment_id":["j95z"],"permalink":"/+uuid/post/5jpp/uuidbot-is-back-at-posting-every/j9sk","post_id":"5jpp","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["j9sk"],"permalink":"/+uuid/post/5jpp/uuidbot-is-back-at-posting-every/ja2i","post":{"author_name":"Spy","award_count":1,"body":"RIP hourly posting, you won't be missed.","body_html":"<p>RIP hourly posting, you won't be missed.</p>\n","comment_count":36,"created_utc":1607384176,"domain":"text post","downvotes":3,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_5jpp","guild_id":"4ns","guild_name":"uuid","herald_guild":null,"id":"5jpp","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+uuid/post/5jpp/uuidbot-is-back-at-posting-every","score":10,"thumb_url":null,"title":"UUIDbot is back at posting every 12 hours.","upvotes":13,"url":""},"post_id":"5jpp","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":0}

You just seem like a savant who has a 150+ IQ in addition to a fair amount of creativity. I'm more like a 120 IQ (most studies find that to be an inherited trait, mine is one of the lowest I've seen from our types, yours is one of the highest) and have zero creativity (seems to be harder for men for some reason, all the others I know with our personality are male and none of them have it either, and I doubt the stereotype of girls being more creative most of the time is an accident). And I am very slow and have trouble doing things consistently and properly, everything turns out to be a mess, and I can't find or learn things very fast either (probably executive functioning issues, which I also pretty much just have to live with). And even a lot of the stuff I can do and know is just me mimicking the actually smart people. All those traits appear to be fixed at birth, which is why I get so angry sometimes because I know I can't really do anything about any of them. I feel an inclination towards the same things you do but my ability and brainpower to do them is nerfed.

I'm more like a 120 IQ (most studies find that to be an inherited trait, mine is one of the lowest I've seen from our types, yours is one of the highest) and have zero creativity (seems to be harder for men for some reason, all the others I know with our personality are male and none of them have it either, and I doubt the stereotype of girls being more creative most of the time is an accident). And I am very slow and have trouble doing things consistently and properly, everything turns out to be a mess, and I can't find or learn things very fast either (probably executive functioning issues, which I also pretty much just have to live with).
