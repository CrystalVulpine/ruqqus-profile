I saw some talk about it on discord.</p>\n<p>Also how did you know that giving negative coins would allow for getting infinite? 1) I would think that would actually count as negative and remove coins or not affect them, how did you just know that they'd turn positive? 2) And how were you able to tip yourself? 3) And even knowing they would turn positive, how did you know that the price wouldn't also? This bug I only found because it's super easy to spot, but something like negative coin values, especially with that many different possible scenarios, is much more difficult to figure out.
