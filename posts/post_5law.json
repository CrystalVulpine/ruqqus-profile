What if everything that was ever posted was mirrored in a guild called <a href=\"/+All\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+All/pic/profile\"/>+All</a>... And GuildMasters could link posts from <a href=\"/+All\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+All/pic/profile\"/>+All</a> into their guilds, but all posts would show in <a href=\"/+All\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+All/pic/profile\"/>+All</a> regardless?</p>\n<p>That is, even if you posted in <a href=\"/+Aww\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Aww/pic/profile\"/>+Aww</a> or something, it would still appear in <a href=\"/+All\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+All/pic/profile\"/>+All</a>, and multiple guilds could \"yank\" into their guild if they saw fit. So one post could theoritically show up in multiple guilds at once, or you could look at <a href=\"/+All\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+All/pic/profile\"/>+All</a>.</p>\n<p>Now that I think about it, the sheer volumn of posts over time would probably make this not a great idea...but I'm posting it anyway because I already wrote the whole thing down.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1607542127, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_jcvt", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1575480088, "description": "The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcbb No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udfea Ruqqus-related only.
