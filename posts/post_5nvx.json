This puzzled me for a long time, as I couldn't imagine why someone would seem to take a perverse sense of achievement in constantly feeling victimized, offended and threatened (\"unsafe\") by many things. It then occurred to me that this was exactly the point. For some of these people, bereft of any sense of accomplishment they have achieved through their own individual efforts, realize they can gain a sense of social status by constantly feeling aggrieved and getting other to recognize, validate and elevate them. Since this is their only channel to achieve any sense of psychological empowerment and social status, it benefits them to keep seeking out and identifying \"problematic\" people or situations as never-ending grist for their mental mill. \n\nIt also makes me wonder whether this why some aspects of critical social theory that see our social institutions shot through with power dynamics of domination/subordination appeal to these people - if you constantly see oppression everywhere explaining everything, then there is always a convenient scapegoat to blame for your individual life problems. Something caused by the \"dominant\" group is always \"problematic\" or causing you \"trauma.\"\n\nThe more victimized they are, real or imagined, the more they can claim to be so superior for \"fighting back\", by actively attacking and trying to tear down their perceived aggressors. And since they always seek out more and more things to be offended/victimized by, there's a never-ending supply of offense they can take, and constantly bemoan their plight of being victims.
