[He made a post where he said he left reddit](https://archive.is/INd7m). Apparently, [he has alts](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nfi/ali07-got-banned-from-the-discord/jl07), but I'm not sure which site this is referring to. He also had a guild, +Ali07 ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211175917/https://ruqqus.com/+Ali07)).\r\n\r\nAccording to his ban reason, he was apparently trying to \"[distribute CP to a minor](https://ruqqus.com/+DeuxRAMA/post/5nel/ali07-is-a-pedophile)\". I can't say I know much about this situation, so all I can do is provide quotes from the discord and ruqqus itself.\r\n\r\nFrom @carpathianflorist (xXjesusXfanX420X69Xx#1488) on the discord: \"Ali was making fbi reports for cp on Reddit, appears to have offered the links, bid made a joke but it looked bad so he got temp banned. Context showed ali set it up tho so bid is free and Ali is banned again\", where \"bid\" is Bidpots\r\n\r\n[It's the same story as the one told in this thread](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nbp/bidpots-went-a-little-over-the).\r\n\r\nAli07 was specifically banned for this statement: \"[can i trust you with links that probably lead to child p*rn?](https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5nfi/JDDdVqEVmYY)\".\r\n\r\nAccording to CrystalVulpine, Ali07 was referring to [modmail screenshots](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nfi/ali07-got-banned-from-the-discord/jkr9) that would serve as proof of a cp attack on /r/WatchRedditDie, and apparently Ali07 reported the links to law enforcement in 3 different countries. CrystalVulpine says that Ali07 said the above statement because he wanted to know whether he can trust Bidpots to not visit the links.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried asking Bidpots a bit about this situation, and [apparently it went something like this](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nfi/ali07-got-banned-from-the-discord/jlnn):\r\n\r\n1. Ali07 was talking in #ruqqus-talk about his ban from discord/getting unbanned\r\n2. Bidpots and others joked about him having CP links, and Bidpots jokingly asked for links from him\r\n3. At some point, Ali07 sends [this message](https://i.ruqqus.com/comment/jjts/CTNh-_qyrJI)\r\n4. In the entire conversation, there was no mention of WRD or the \"CP attacks\" there whatsoever.\r\n5. Bidpots was banned for his jokes, but he was unbanned after captainmeta4 saw [this comment](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/5nbp/bidpots-went-a-little-over-the/jjv9?context=3)\r\n\r\nWhat I do not know: I do not know why Ali07 offered to send the screenshots in the first place, since Bidpots was just joking, and apparently /r/WatchRedditDie wasn't mentioned in their conversation. I tried looking at Bidpots and CrystalVulpine's conversation for more information, but it was kind of hard to follow.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn the past, Ali07 has been banned from the discord before for \"defending pedophilia\", but given that the [admins have a lot of \"anti-pedo\" rules](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/3sjt/posting-the-discord-antipedo-rules-spiel), I can't say for sure what he actually did. He said he was banned for \"[asking a question](https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusDiscord/post/4jyz/the-moderation-of-the-ruqqus-discord)\", but I don't know what the question was...\r\n\r\nThere was also some drama with him and LuigiHelpsOut in the past.
