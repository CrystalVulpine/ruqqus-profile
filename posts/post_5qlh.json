Here's a list for reference. I excluded admins and novelty accounts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@eagle\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@eagle/pic/profile\"/>@eagle</a> 110 subscribers, last active one month ago</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> 77 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@NeonRevolt\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@NeonRevolt/pic/profile\"/>@NeonRevolt</a> 73 subscribers, last active 2 months ago</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@Inaki\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Inaki/pic/profile\"/>@Inaki</a> 31 subscribers...1 post 5 months ago and zero comments??!!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@AngstKitten\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AngstKitten/pic/profile\"/>@AngstKitten</a> 20 subscribers, last posted 1 month ago and only comments a couple times per month</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@Sentient\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sentient/pic/profile\"/>@Sentient</a> 18 subscribers, last active 3 months ago</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For comparison, here's a list of ones I think actually make sense. Notice the huge gap in followers between these and the unexplained ones:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@stars_in_blue_major\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@stars_in_blue_major/pic/profile\"/>@stars_in_blue_major</a> 41 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@TrumpVoter1\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@TrumpVoter1/pic/profile\"/>@TrumpVoter1</a> 32 subscribers (private profile which may cause a small drop)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@CrystalVulpine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@CrystalVulpine/pic/profile\"/>@CrystalVulpine</a> 31 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@LlamaBean\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@LlamaBean/pic/profile\"/>@LlamaBean</a> 23 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@Meguminnnn\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Meguminnnn/pic/profile\"/>@Meguminnnn</a> 23 subscribers (seems a tiny bit excessive because he's not <em>that</em> active but that could just be luck)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a> 20 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@no_chill\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@no_chill/pic/profile\"/>@no_chill</a> 20 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@VILLAIN\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@VILLAIN/pic/profile\"/>@VILLAIN</a> 19 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/@Bidpots\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Bidpots/pic/profile\"/>@Bidpots</a> 17 subscribers</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What's also weird is how big the gap is. There's <strong>no one</strong> in the 45-65 range. It jumps immediately from 41 all the way to 73. And <em>all</em> the ones in the 70-120 range are these unexplained cases.</p>\n<p>I really don't see how this works. I've never even heard of many of the ones on the first list, all the power users are on the second one. So I'm not really sure what's going on here. Anyone have any guesses?</p>\n", "comment_count": 61, "created_utc": 1607962497, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1607964581, "fullname": "t2_5qlh", "guild_id": "2", "guild_name": "Ruqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5qlh", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/5qlh/how-do-some-accounts-get-tons", "score": 37, "thumb_url": null, "title": "How do some accounts get tons of followers for no apparent reason?", "upvotes": 33, "url": ""}, "post_id": "5qlh", "score": 2, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
