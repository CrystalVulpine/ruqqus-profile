I know most people are just autistic trolls.</p>\n<p>That being said, I do have reason to believe they are ledt by a few shills, who are coordinating the \"le ebic trolling\", as it \"just happens\" to coincide with a propaganda campaign by the left and have the exact same effect.

Notice it's not the case on any other post.</p>\n<h2>This Post Addresses a Strawman</h2>\n<p>You can keep talking how everybody fell for you \"le ebic bait\".</p>\n<p>The actual shilling was not the trolling - it was the few organizers coordinated trolling (maybe even just one of them convining others to do it \"for the lulz\") targeting a very specific subject, who just \"happens\" to coincide with an ongoing shilling campaign by the MSM propaganda machine.</p>\n<p>The \"subversion\", and pretending people fell for it, is an attempt to divert people from this fact, trying to make them think this guild is about that - it isn't. As you well know, most people related to this (except those who spammed this guild) are neither exiled nor mentioned in the threads here.
