{"author_name": "Emerald41", "award_count": 1, "body": "This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things.

Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close.

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming.

This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false.

This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale.

This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming.

Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned.

Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned.

To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy.

This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming.

Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them.

Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false.

Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse.

The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign.

Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of).

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots.

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close.

Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.

A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close.

Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of).

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious.

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery.

This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present.

I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale.

To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot.

Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false.

We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close.

The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming.

Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History. If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0</a></p>\n<p>If this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP.

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things.

Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close.

Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful.

The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of).

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

If you're too lazy or lack the brainpower to read through this, i would recommend checking out this video: https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0\r\n\r\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, downvote and move on. Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned.

However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy.

A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong?

This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause.

This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence.

To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> came in and confirmed everything Kek had said.</p>\n<p>Edit - Adding this link: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a</a></p>\n<h2>The aftermath</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a>, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> of being pedos trying to groom me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than</a></p>\n<p>I'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\">https://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g</a></p>\n<h2>Legacy of the RCP</h2>\n<p>And now we find ourselves at the present. Much of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> is still in denial and some guilds (Such as <a href=\"/+BasedMemes\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+BasedMemes/pic/profile\"/>+BasedMemes</a>) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, &amp; AHS are active forces on Ruqqus.</p>\n<p>However, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter.</p>\n<p>If you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving <a href=\"/@AsininePorcupine\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@AsininePorcupine/pic/profile\"/>@AsininePorcupine</a>'s post a read: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\">https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills</a></p>\n<p>Now that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...</p>\n<h2>Why did the RCP do this?</h2>\n<p>Just about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang.</p>\n<p>I personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much time was put into the RCP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notable Contributors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not do this all on my own.

Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own.

Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead. ", "body_html": "<p>This is the story of the Ruqqus corrective project and its involvement in the greatest troll op in Ruqqus History.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Precursor</h2>\n<p>A group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was <a href=\"/+The_DonaId\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+The_DonaId/pic/profile\"/>+The_DonaId</a>, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>It all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. Before I posted it however, users <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> and <a href=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@EmbraceTheMonke/pic/profile\"/>@EmbraceTheMonke</a> gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it.</p>\n<p>And fall for it they did. <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many</a></p>\n<p>The post got 120+ upvotes in <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity.</p>\n<h2>RCP involvement</h2>\n<p>After seeing the operation's success, user <a href=\"/@carpathianflorist\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@carpathianflorist/pic/profile\"/>@carpathianflorist</a> decided to create a Discord server just for trolling <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> again.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> fell for it hard: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on</a></p>\n<p>For the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been</a></p>\n<h2>Final Phase</h2>\n<p>After a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> &amp; <a href=\"/@acikek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@acikek/pic/profile\"/>@acikek</a>, and site admin <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\">https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort</a></p>\n<p>The post sparked a lot of controversy, and <a href=\"/@milkit\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@milkit/pic/profile\"/>@milkit</a> (GM of <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a>) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, <a href=\"/@Seq37\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Seq37/pic/profile\"/>@Seq37</a> gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban <a href=\"/@Sion321\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@Sion321/pic/profile\"/>@Sion321</a>. Needless to say, <a href=\"/+TheMemery\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+TheMemery/pic/profile\"/>+TheMemery</a> freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned.

Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.

Unless you have some creative insults to drop other than fag, shill, tranny, retard, nig, troll, etc. I'm telling you this story for the first time, so I would at least expect some new insults for the first time. Ruqqus users are famous for their stubborn consistency and a lack of willingness to change their language or beliefs. Can you prove me wrong? Because this stubbornness to accept other opinions and unwillingness to listen to logic is what lead to this drama in the first place. \r\n\r\n## Precursor\r\n\r\nA group of users gathered together on election day to create a revolutionary guild to troll the few other users on this site. This guild was +The_Donaid, where any dissenting opinions were banned (quite similar to a certain meme guild we all know of). As of now, it boasts 250+ members. However, these users wanted more, and they would lay the foundation for the creation of the RCP.\r\n\r\n## The Beginning \r\n\r\nIt all started out with me (@Emerald41) and a couple of other Ruqqus guildmasters leaving random quotes that were really bizarre out of context. I had the idea of taking screenshots of these out of context quotes and putting them together to post them in +TheMemery. Before I posted it however, users @CarpathianFlorist and @EmbraceTheMonke gave me some memes and advice to prep my alt account, @Sion321, to make the account look more trustworthy. Once the account was ready, the collage was posted, and we waited to see if anyone would fall for it. \r\n\r\nAnd fall for it they did. https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5c0y/milkit-predicted-this-evidence-of-many\r\n\r\nThe post got 120+ upvotes in +TheMemery, and many people fell for it. A majority of the people that denied it in the comments were downvoted and/or banned from the guild. Overall, it was a massive success. I was considering ending it there, but other GMs seeing its success, also wanted to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind opportunity. \r\n\r\n## RCP involvement \r\n\r\nAfter seeing the operation's success, user @CarpathianFlorist decided to create a Discord server just for trolling +TheMemery. This became the Ruqqus Corrective Project Discord server. 20+ Gms were added to this Discord, many of whom provided great contributions to the cause. Within a week, I had enough screenshots to make another collage of out of context quotes and posted them to +TheMemery again. \r\n\r\nOnce again, +TheMemery fell for it hard: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5ee9/more-evidence-of-ahs-involvement-on\r\n\r\nFor the next part, we decided to leak the RCP server invite so that skeptics could get their own screenshots as evidence. We pretended to be clueless, but in fact, it was all a ruse to give people time to get their \"evidence.\" Now, it was practically undeniable that the \"cabal\" existed since multiple users now had \"evidence\". \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5lsh/urgent-ccpahs-discord-link-has-been\r\n\r\n## Final Phase \r\n\r\nAfter a while, we decided it was time to bring the RCP to a close. We had our fun, but we wanted to go out with a bang. Over time, we picked up even more users. The most prominent among these were devs @Seq37 & @Acikek, and site admin @Kek who joined a day before the finale. I asked Seq and Acikek to to DM me saying that they will deactivate Sion321 if I don't delete my previous \"bombshells.\" I took screenshots of these DMs and created the final collage and posted them to +TheMemery\r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5qyy/two-code-contributors-of-some-sort\r\n\r\nThe post sparked a lot of controversy, and @Milkit (GM of +TheMemery) was suspicious. To allay his suspicions, @Seq37 gave me the idea of spamming comments in one of his private guilds to trigger the anti-spam system to ban @Sion321. Needless to say, +TheMemery freaked out, and users demanded statements from site admins for a reason why Sion was banned. Site admin @Kek came in first and told the guild all about the RCP and how I intentionally got Sion321 banned by spamming. The users (including milkit) denied all of it, lashing out at Kek, calling him a liar and incompetent among other things. Very few people believed it, until site admin @Captainmeta4 came in and confirmed everything Kek had said. \r\n\r\nEdit - Adding this link: https://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5r1h/so-sion123-was-threatened-with-a\r\n\r\n## The aftermath \r\n\r\n@Milkit, realizing he had been played hard, started to again lash out against the admins calling them trolls and whatnot. Desperately grasping for straws, he found an out-of-context comment by Carp saying that I was a young girl. Ironic considering all this drama was caused because of out-of-context screenshots. Using Carp's comment as evidence, milkit accused @CarpathianFlorist and @Kek of being pedos trying to groom me. \r\n\r\nhttps://ruqqus.com/+TheMemery/post/5rcc/omg-its-even-more-pathetic-than\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna reveal my age, but I will say I'm older than 18, so already that claim is false. Also, neither Carp nor Kek have any romantic interest in me, and I don't have any romantic interest in them. This was just milkit's attempt to deflect attention from himself after being humiliated in his own circlejerk which we colloquially call +TheMemery. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.ruqqus.com/post/5rnd/EVqVQFr2__g\r\n\r\n## Legacy of the RCP \r\n\r\nAnd now we find ourselves at the present. Much of +TheMemery is still in denial and some guilds (Such as +BasedMemes) are taking precautionary measures against threats that don't even exist. We sucessfully managed to convince a good portion of the site that shills, the CCP, & AHS are active forces on Ruqqus. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you take a step back, you can easily tell all of this was a grand ruse. The CCP and AHS aren't interested in an obscure forum in which Discord screenshots and 4chan posts are used as evidence. The word \"shill\" has been thrown around so much that its lost its meaning. The only genuine shill (by definition) on this site is that TEFL reposter. \r\n\r\nIf you want a more deep analysis of the moral of this saga, I would reccomend giving @AsininePorcupine's post a read: https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/5s60/the-difference-between-trolls-and-shills\r\n\r\nNow that our fun is over, the RCP has decided to come to a close. The Ruqqus Corrective Project will no longer be operational. However all this begs the question...\r\n\r\n## Why did the RCP do this?\r\n\r\nJust about everyone has varying reasons for joining/participating in the RCP. Some just wanted a chance to get back at milkit. Others just thought it looked liked fun. Others wanted to prove a point. Some users wanted a way to leave Ruqqus with a bang. \r\n\r\nI personally did it to prove a point: How disastrous exclusively staying inside an echo chamber (such as the memery) is. \r\n\r\n> How much time was put into the RCP?\r\n\r\nIt varies between users, but overall most users put in a grand total of 2 hours or less. The more active RCP members (such as Carp, myself, and a couple others) put in a total of about 4 hours. So really, this wasn't a high effort campaign. Makes it all the more bizarre that people fell for it in the first place. \r\n\r\n> Notable Contributors\r\n\r\nI did not do this all on my own. There were numerous contributors to this cause that helped make it successful. Among these notable contributors are:\r\n\r\n@AsininePorcupine\r\n@no_chill\r\n@CarpathianFlorist\r\n@EmbracetheMonke\r\n@Seq37\r\n@Acikek\r\n@Kek\r\n@SomeoneAtThePhone\r\n@Bidpots\r\n@Villain\r\n@freeday\r\n@notabot\r\n@Regmadan\r\n@l1terally_h1tler\r\n\r\n> As for the other RCP members, if you want to chime in to assert your association with our glorious project, go ahead.
