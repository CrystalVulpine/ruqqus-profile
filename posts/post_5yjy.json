Captainmeta4 by comparison doesn't pander to power users and is far more hands-off.</p>\n<p>I mean the Reddit admins <a href=\"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">do have a set of moderator guidelines that require mods to</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have clear &amp; concise rules - not banning users for secret/hidden rules.</li>\n<li>Not punish users based on their actions in another community</li>\n<li>Take appeals seriously. Appeals must be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is that Reddit's admins rarely, if ever enforce these guidelines, and usually it's to oppress subreddits that the cabal of Reddit power mods don't like, i.e. everything that happened to /r/the_donald in the past year. If they did, any mods who employed bots to auto-ban people for commenting in \"hate subreddits\" they don't like, or rudely modmail muting and blocking people with no response (because how fucking dare they lodge an appeal against their unfair subreddit ban) would have been purged from the site - not given more powers.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1608660003, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1608660045, "fullname": "t3_krbs", "guild_id": "1", "herald_guild": null, "id": "krbs", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent_comment_id": ["knx3"], "permalink": "/+general/post/5yjy/hi-everyone-greetings-from-voat-seems/krbs", "post_id": "5yjy", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["krbs"], "permalink": "/+general/post/5yjy/hi-everyone-greetings-from-voat-seems/kscy", "post": {"author_name": "Greasy", "award_count": 0, "body": "Get ready for a fuckton of refugees!", "body_html": "<p>Get ready for a fuckton of refugees!</p>\n", "comment_count": 34, "created_utc": 1608581631, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 5, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_5yjy", "guild_id": "1", "guild_name": "general", "herald_guild": null, "id": "5yjy", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+general/post/5yjy/hi-everyone-greetings-from-voat-seems", "score": 19, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Hi everyone, greetings from Voat.
