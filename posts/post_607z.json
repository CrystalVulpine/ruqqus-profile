Things which give guildmasters the obligation to set reasonable rules and guidelines and which give rights to the end user.

Punish rule violations appropriately. i.e. exiling a user for something as menial as not flairing a post is not a fair punishment. Exiling users for persistent toxicity, incivility and derailing discussions is fair game on the other hand.\n\n3. Take comment deletion and exile appeals seriously. If your response to fair appeals *(like many of the power mod cucks on Reddit)* is to tell the user to fuck off or rudely mute/block them with no reply, you should be stripped of Guildmaster privileges. In situations like this the admins absolutely should intervene. Abusive power mods is one of the main things killing Reddit and is why I think the site is just one decent alternative away from being dethroned or even thrown into obscurity like Digg was.\n\n4. Don't employ bots to automatically censor comments or exile users. Shit like Automoderator shouldn't be allowed to take hold on Ruqqus. Any kind of comment filtering should be down to the end user.\n\n5. Don't exile users for their actions in another guild. This is a massive problem on Reddit that many subs like /r/offmychest and /r/justiceserved are especially guilty of. If you even comment in communities like KotakuInAction or TheRedPill for instance, bots will auto ban you from dozens of subreddits and even though that's a violation of Reddit's own guidelines, the site's admins won't do shit to stop it and won't even respond to moderator complaints.", "body_html": "<p>This is the best thing you could have done to quell complaints and shows that Ruqqus has far more integrity than Reddit does.</p>\n<p>To be honest I think Ruqqus needs <a href=\"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a set of guildmaster guidelines similar to what Reddit has</a>.
