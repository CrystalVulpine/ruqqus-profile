There's a fringe of social conservatism that has always demanded a strong state. They're still a fringe. They're usually the muppets that back whatever neocon rino bullshit that the usual faces push. They're the support base that helped bush get into Iraq. They're useful idiots.\r\n\r\nThese types have always existed but they were an extreme minority (I can't say I had ever even met one in real life before).

Those things remain in effect after those administrations are gone.</p>\n<p>What the media labels as, and what you seem to believe is, conservatives being more \"far-right\" than they were in the past is simply people on the right trying to move us back towards where we were in like the year 2000. That's the kind of fighting back that I'm talking about.  When politicians do things that the media disagrees it's typical for them to try to depict those actions as authoritarian. They're basically making a kind of procedural argument that legislation that the media agrees with should not be changed unless there is a massive public mandate from lots of politicians winning elections based on their promise to do so.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1608942737, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_l4cx", "guild_id": "1v", "herald_guild": null, "id": "l4cx", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 5, "parent_comment_id": ["l48y"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/631x/conservatives-why-have-you-forsaken-libertarianism/l4cx", "post_id": "631x", "score": 5, "upvotes": 5, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["l4cx"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/631x/conservatives-why-have-you-forsaken-libertarianism/l4lv", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "It's undeniable that the central tenets of the (US) conservatives used to be small, limited government, states rights, individual liberty, free markets, free speech, etc. With a few exceptions (such as the war on drugs and the death penalty), conservatives were basically a more moderate version of libertarian, and there was a lot of spillover from one to the other.\r\n\r\nHowever in the past few years that has definitely changed.

I haven't seen it in its purest form since about a decade ago or maybe even before that, but it's really picked up in the past 1-2 years. Conservatives are now suddenly demanding a strong state, control of the people, censorship, tough laws banning things they determined have a negative impact on society, more restricted individual rights, etc. They've basically become the left with a right-wing agenda. This was a really fast change and it's been shocking to me; I still have trouble believing it. What's the hardest is seeing all my conservative friends changing at once and suddenly going from mostly believers in freedom to solid authoritarians in a really short time.

As long as you're not trying to force your will on someone else. But you said earlier that we need to deny freedom to women and blacks and jews.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Currently it is encouraged, glorified (falsely so, there is no glory in dried ovaries and loneliness for fooled 40-year old women)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually there is, singleness is in fact a gift and not everyone can recieve it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and diversity quotas are enforced by law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah those are bullshit. SJWs go on and on about \"racist sexist misogynist homophobic transphobic islamaphobic bigots\", yet they're the ones insisting we make decisions based on these attributes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even men don't play strategy games that often, women even less so, especially grand strategy, and, guess what, those require long-term planning to win along with a strong attention span.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like I said, it's because most women are just weird and girly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jews maybe, but others nah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I literally gave you several examples, and you're blatantly choosing to ignore them because it doesn't confirm your fascist utopia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorry about the wording, what I wanted to ask is how much you actually enjoy playing them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would enjoy them a lot, if I could actually do them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And lemme tell you something, prejudices are actually GOOD, because, if the prejudice is wrong, it only gives you opportunity to rise up further than you could if you're a decent person (say you become a 6 from a -2, it's an 8 point rise compared to a 6 from 0).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't really get what you're saying here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who said Jesus is a villain? I'd much rather call those who killed him villains and I think you can guess who that is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They were, and they were <em>his own people</em>. I'm not surprised you wouldn't like him, he had quite a bit of concern for people you seem to think are worthless (ironically you have much in common with da joos who got him crucified because that is one of the things they hated about him). I bet you think he's the pinnacle of Jewish brainwashing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, we can only guess, but judging by how successful his country was during his short reign until it got ganged upon by the entire world, I tend to think he was a good genius with good intentions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or he was just obsessed with power and success. If having a more efficient society costs your entire well-being and causes you to live in terror every second of your life and give up your freedom in almost every aspect, is that really worth it? I wouldn't make that trade-off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How is that unfortunate? It increases biodiversity and makes things more fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's only fun for the people who have the advantages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, you do realise that a genius woman would be more useful if she produced genius children than if she burned away at some useless job?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could say the same exact thing about a man. I'd also like to add, your idea of meaning seems is purely biological and you seem to have no spiritual discernment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>neural networks can very easily determine your race by scaling your genetics</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, by looking at that trait, not your other ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there aren't trillions of traits, lmao, there aren't even that many alleles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that's the case then how is everyone unique except identical twins? By your logic there should be several clones of everyone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can refuse a burger, but how often do you choose to, especially when suffering no punishment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, there are people who do and it's not fair to judge them by others' actions. I myself am often annoyed by stuff that everyone else just does.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that's just one gene of which there are many, which are more prevalent in blacks than whites or vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You just got done saying there's only a few genes that determine everything!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just watch your TV and physically count how many times there is a black man with a white woman in an ad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's called woke college SJWs who are 90% white men, not jews.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_in_the_closet_(idiom)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_in_the_closet_(idiom)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone's got that, but I'm not sure how that relates to this. They are very clearly ultra excelling, some of them damn near perfect in almost every area, and what they've done proves it. I don't know what could change that fact, even if they turn out to be awful people (I doubt it knowing them) the fact that they excel to the point of insanity still remains.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609108376, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1609195010, "fullname": "t3_lcp8", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1581786138, "description": "Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Posts must be questions.
