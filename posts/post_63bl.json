Thanks.","body_html":"<p>As a new user, who is looking for a platform that values free speech, it is rather discouraging to see this kind of organized commandeering and defacing of guilds, for expressing controversial ideas, with clear and expressed intent to shut those ideas down and drive them out. Especially since it was allegedly done with assistance and blessing from the administration.</p>\n<p>Could you please clarify a few things, to help users like me decide if this platform is really what it claims to be?</p>\n<p>The individuals who perpetrated the siege made this claim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of this was possible due to <a href=\"/@captainmeta4\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@captainmeta4/pic/profile\"/>@captainmeta4</a> 's good communication and coordination with us, hopefully we can continue to clean up ruqqus together!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this true? Did you coordinate with them and thereby enable the siege?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we will also be reversing sieges that were enabled as a result of the original permanent ban</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does that include guilds like <a href=\"/+GenderCriticaL\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+GenderCriticaL/pic/profile\"/>+GenderCriticaL</a> and <a href=\"/+AntiWhite\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+AntiWhite/pic/profile\"/>+AntiWhite</a>, which were taken over more than 3 weeks ago? Why was there no intervention then?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because the guild siege feature is intertwined with permanent/temporary ban status</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does that mean that sieges, in general, are permitted? So having alts is a bannable offense, but maliciously stealing, defacing and destroying guilds is fair game?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, it has come to our attention that some of the sieges were themselves conducted using alternate accounts to bypass the siege cooldown. These users and accounts will be dealt with accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What exactly does \"dealt with accordingly\" mean? Because \"treating all users equally\" would mean banning them. For the alts, if not for the siege.</p>\n<p>But this kind of vague wording is usually used when admins want to do anything other than \"deal with it accordingly\", and just brush it under the rug with a slap on the wrist.</p>\n<p>Would appreciate candid answers.
