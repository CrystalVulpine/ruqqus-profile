For example, yesterday I doubt @captainmeta4 actually woke up and said \"how can I get @JosephGoebbels banned so @carpathianflorist can take his guilds?\". But that is how I come across, especially during chaotic times like that. What I mean is, I feel like captainmeta4 did catch an incident but that he had a distaste for JG so it affected his decisions unknowingly. Similarly, DGK was banned for a really petty, likely accidental offense. Same thing there, I don't think captainmeta4 woke up and said \"I want to get DGK banned\" but I do think that the tension between them affected his decision and is why the punishment was so harsh; normally I'd expect him to have gotten a warning or a temp ban. Jason and Civil's stories are similar.\r\n\r\nThe discord mod thing, too, is the exact same way. Do the admins purposely pick out users they like and try to form an in-group? Do they try to think of all the ways they can give them extra special treatment? Of course not, but they do have a bias towards a few users for some reason and it ends up that way. They tend to pick the same people for most things, and just think that they can and should be trusted with more privileges than everyone else, ethics slipping their mind in this instance since they think it's not a big deal. When those users abuse their privileges or bend more minor rules, the admins see it differently than with anyone else; they're somewhat friends, and when someone you're friends with does something it looks more justified than it would otherwise. Likewise if someone you have a distrust for does something it seems worse than it otherwise would. I think that's what's happening here. I just think the admins are too carefree about these sorts of problems and incorrectly assert that they're not even happening, because from their perspective it seems normal. They need to be more careful about not showing favoritism or nepotism, and not giving any unnecessary extra privileges or reductions of privileges, or making biased decisions or giving preferential treatment; even if it's \"not a big deal\", a little leaven leavens the whole lump.\r\n\r\nWhen I talk about a \"cabal\", I am *not* referring to any currently existing group on this site.

I just think the admins are too carefree about these sorts of problems and incorrectly assert that they're not even happening, because from their perspective it seems normal.
