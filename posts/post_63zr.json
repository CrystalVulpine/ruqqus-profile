A good amount of Ruqqord users want to shit on and drive users they don\u2019t like off the site and admins seem to want to replace their base and cater to a more mainstream audience. These users for all intents and purposes hate Ruqqus and Ruqqus users, would be happier on Reddit, and are consistently (purposely) demoralizing when it doesn\u2019t make sense to be. Yet the admins seem more than willing to take cues from them. \r\n\r\nSo you have users that are generally popular or at least neutral with the Ruqqus base getting eyed, jumped on, and treated spitefully by the admins because the Ruqqord base hates and constantly complains about those users. Yet, you\u2019ve got those same Ruqqord users in the RCP server planning brigades, sieging and subverting guilds of users they get banned, playing Carps games and being obnoxious to everybody else and the Admins do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe admins always side with Ruqqord over the Ruqqus base. Because they don\u2019t like the Ruqqus base. And, Ruqqord is really just a few loud, whiny people typing the same thing over and over and then the rest just falling in line after they know what to think. \r\n\r\nBasically, it seems like they want Reddit\u2019s userbase and resent the niche that they already have and can build upon because it doesn\u2019t make Ruqqus look favorable to the mainstream.
