Hopefully more people will trickle and filling the site with more organic posts relating to other topics, but that may be a long while off if the climate continues as it is. That's why I'm actually really supportive of the moderators. When they were discussing what to do with the abundance of political posts on the site I suggested that further action should be reserved until after the election and I was surprise they responded and agreed with me. They actually discuss and have been very transparent with the community instead of with the Reddit changes where it's basically their way or the highway being on their knees for AHS. So I don't see why shitting on them for having a spine and not shilling out to the mob mentality scene I'm seeing more and more of on the site is a bad thing.\n\nThat said I'm a firm believer in free speech as well as freedom of accessibility so if more filtering changes are implemented I'd like it to be very upfront and not hidden beneath a multitude of options, similar to picking SFW or NSFW. Cultivating the site to be more apolitical I would see as desirable so it become actually a better Reddit instead of a different side of the same coin.","body_html":"<p>Honestly the 'userbase' is hurting Ruqqus' potential by just being reverse Reddit upvoting the 10,000th corrupt jew post to where it floods the main page with propaganda similar to Reddit's front page evil white male posts.

I supported the admins' decision to hide political guilds from All by default - it should help cultivate a broader audience by bolstering non-political guilds. Without those, Ruqqus is basically just Voat but slightly less degenerate.</p>\n<p>What I <em>don't</em> support, however, is the formation of Ruqqus's AHS analogue (Ruqqus Corrective Project), the weaponization of the platform's Siege function, and the approval these actions seem to have from the admins. This runs counter to the platform's core value: free speech.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping that the admins will see this outcry from their community and find a way to make the site presentable to non-political users, while not stifling those who want to participate in the political side of things. It seems like once they modify the Siege function to only be usable in the case of inactive GMs, we'll see some progress.</p>\n","created_utc":1609025750,"downvotes":8,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_l8mg","guild_id":"2","herald_guild":null,"id":"l8mg","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+Ruqqus/post/644f/if-youre-wondering-heres-whats-going/l8mg","post_id":"644f","score":11,"upvotes":20,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["l8mg"],"permalink":"/+Ruqqus/post/644f/if-youre-wondering-heres-whats-going/lkf3","post":{"author_name":"Madje","award_count":0,"body":"Long story short, admins and a majority of Ruqqus Discord strongly dislike the current “nazi” - yeah, they use that term unironically - userbase.
