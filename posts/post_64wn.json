So it's pretty fucking scary to find out one of the only people with the power to censor you on this site took it upon himself to take control of a guild and apply a category that he unilaterally decided was \"correct\", presumably with no input from the other guildmasters, admins, or ruqqies of that guild. He didn't announce he'd be doing this sort of thing, nor explain why; there's no rule nor anything in the ToS that states this should happen. He just did it because he thinks he's right. Not a quality you want in an allegedly neutral arbiter of content.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609188750, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1609188805, "fullname": "t3_lguh", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1596492824, "description": "ruqqus.com changelog ", "description_html": "<p><a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a> changelog</p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_2u5", "id": "2u5", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": true, "is_siege_protected": true, "name": "changelog", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+changelog", "profile_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-icon.png"}, "guild_id": "2u5", "herald_guild": null, "id": "lguh", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 3, "parent": {"author_name": "Spy", "award_count": 0, "body": "ok, and?", "body_html": "<p>ok, and?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609108532, "downvotes": 35, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_lcpo", "guild_id": "2u5", "herald_guild": null, "id": "lcpo", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["lc7u"], "permalink": "/+changelog/post/64wn/ruqqus-2293-category-improvements/lcpo", "post_id": "64wn", "score": -21, "upvotes": 17, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["lcpo"], "permalink": "/+changelog/post/64wn/ruqqus-2293-category-improvements/lguh", "post": {"author_name": "captainmeta4", "award_count": 2, "body": "The following changes will be made:\r\n\r\n* Removal of the \"politics\" filter in user settings, since the category system makes it redundant.\r\n* Improvements to the way categories and subcategories are handled on the back end.\r\n* All categories and subcategories now displayed in alphabetical order\r\n* Reworked the category listing to be much more comprehensive.
