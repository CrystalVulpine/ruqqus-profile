We apologize for rushing the feature.\" or \"We won't force the offensive category on any guilds, even if we do think the guild is offensive.\" rather than kicking the posts and banning the authors.\r\n\r\nAlso, as for the \"offensive\" category, they're worried about the subjectivity of the name of the category.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to have /all stay as a place where all guilds are visible and to have the Home feed for logged out users and a new listing (called something like \"Custom\") use the categorization system, but that's just my preference.\r\n\r\n<sup> - sfrohne [If you're going to post a screenshot of this comment, **don't** censor my username]</sup>", "body_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>It's people being upset that others are being given the option to not look at them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, it's not.

That's what they're upset about. They want all the categories to be opt-out (I don't necessarily agree, but that's fine), which means others <em>still have the option to not look at them</em>.</p>\n<p>They're also upset about your response to all this. I also think it's much of an overreaction, but I dislike seeing that you're actually banning them from your guilds for making posts about this. I'm talking about <a href=\"/@FeverDream\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@FeverDream/pic/profile\"/>@FeverDream</a> and the others. That looks much like shutting down dissent, and it's better to just make replies saying something like \"We're going to change the categorization system so it is clearer that certain categories are going to be hidden by default. We apologize for rushing the feature.\" or \"We won't force the offensive category on any guilds, even if we do think the guild is offensive.\" rather than kicking the posts and banning the authors.</p>\n<p>Also, as for the \"offensive\" category, they're worried about the subjectivity of the name of the category.</p>\n<p>I'd prefer to have /all stay as a place where all guilds are visible and to have the Home feed for logged out users and a new listing (called something like \"Custom\") use the categorization system, but that's just my preference.</p>\n<p><sup> - sfrohne [If you're going to post a screenshot of this comment, <strong>don't</strong> censor my username]</sup></p>\n", "created_utc": 1609129317, "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 1609130312, "fullname": "t3_le5t", "guild_id": "2", "herald_guild": null, "id": "le5t", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["le1a"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/65an/its-literally-been-less-then-a/le5t", "post_id": "65an", "score": 21, "upvotes": 26, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["le5t"], "permalink": "/+Ruqqus/post/65an/its-literally-been-less-then-a/lgh7", "post": {"author_name": "Pixtum", "award_count": 0, "body": "As seen here https://ruqqus.com/+ShillWall/post/64sd/captainmeta4-doesnt-like-being-called-out/lbfo the admins were planning on discussing a rework to the \"Offensive\" category.
