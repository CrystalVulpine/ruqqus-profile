We were met with more of the same. From that \"discussion\" it is apparent that the admins are \"done\" with the userbase and would rather just ignore it than deal with \"schizos\" who \"don't listen\" and are now calling them mean names.\r\n\r\nThe Ruqqus Admins fail to acknowledge that the base has gotten to the point of open protest, name-calling, and speculation specifically because of the awful public relations and inability to at least feign impartiality on their part. It is not normal for admins to have such a heated relationship with it's userbase, yet instead of acknowledge the part they've played, they place all of the blame on you for being \"nazis\" or otherwise undesirables.\r\n\r\nQuiet honestly, their behavior tells me don't have what it takes to be business leaders and should've stuck to programming if they can't be bothered to come up with a marketing or business plan for their product, can't definitively communicate their intentions for the site, can't avoid effectively splitting the stakeholders of the site into opposing teams, and can't be assed to understand or even cordially communicate with their userbase about anything other than updates. They'd be better off if they gave the CEO position to someone who can actually behave like and perform CEO duties; maybe that person would've hired an actual marketing and PR person.\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\n**BUT**, I think the thing that we all have and common and the reason that we are all still here is because we *want* Ruqqus to succeed and don't want it to just be another Reddit.\r\n\r\nSo, how about we try to mend the relationship by laying out the questions we need answers to in order to continue to be supporters of the platform and the steps that need to be taken in order to restore user confidence in the dev team.\r\n\r\n**Post your questions and suggestions in the comments and I will select the best ones ( most relevant to the topics of** *attitudes toward the userbase, long-term intentions for the site,* **and** *restoring user confidence* **) to the final Reconciliation Proposal to the Ruqqus Admins.**\r\n\r\n@NothinWrong had some good ones to start off.

A significant portion of the userbase has also expressed that they feel like they no longer know the admins' intentions for the site.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Ruqqus users feel that their thoughts, opinions, and suggestions are often overlooked and disregarded in favor of those from Ruqqus Discord members. These same Discord members seem to differ in usability significant ways from the average Ruqqus user and have been documented expressing open disdain for the current userbase time and time again. It doesn't help that captainmeta4 has been documented telling users that their suggestions don't matter in his usual condescending and dismissive tone (feel free to post that screenshot if you have it on hand).\r\n\r\nCommon words to describe the Ruqqus userbase on the Ruqqus Discord server are \"Nazi\" \"Retarded\" \"Schizo\" \"Stupid\" \"Delusional\" \"Conspiracy Theorist\" among more and they usually conflate all of the base with a user or a group of users they don't like. A lot of people like to clean up the phrasing when talking about admin opinions and Ruqqus Discord, but I don't.\r\n\r\nYour concerns are often dismissed on the basis of this name-calling and strawman-ing regardless of topic and regardless of how respectfully you phrase them. I among others ( @SamRF @stars_in_blue_major) very recently went on Ruqqus Discord and asked for admins to formally address your concerns about the admins' views of the base and about the schism between Ruqqus Discord and the Ruqqus userbase. We were met with more of the same. From that \"discussion\" it is apparent that the admins are \"done\" with the userbase and would rather just ignore it than deal with \"schizos\" who \"don't listen\" and are now calling them mean names.\r\n\r\nThe Ruqqus Admins fail to acknowledge that the base has gotten to the point of open protest, name-calling, and speculation specifically because of the awful public relations and inability to at least feign impartiality on their part. It is not normal for admins to have such a heated relationship with it's userbase, yet instead of acknowledge the part they've played, they place all of the blame on you for being \"nazis\" or otherwise undesirables.\r\n\r\nQuiet honestly, their behavior tells me don't have what it takes to be business leaders and should've stuck to programming if they can't be bothered to come up with a marketing or business plan for their product, can't definitively communicate their intentions for the site, can't avoid effectively splitting the stakeholders of the site into opposing teams, and can't be assed to understand or even cordially communicate with their userbase about anything other than updates. They'd be better off if they gave the CEO position to someone who can actually behave like and perform CEO duties; maybe that person would've hired an actual marketing and PR person.\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\n**BUT**, I think the thing that we all have and common and the reason that we are all still here is because we *want* Ruqqus to succeed and don't want it to just be another Reddit.\r\n\r\nSo, how about we try to mend the relationship by laying out the questions we need answers to in order to continue to be supporters of the platform and the steps that need to be taken in order to restore user confidence in the dev team.\r\n\r\n**Post your questions and suggestions in the comments and I will select the best ones ( most relevant to the topics of** *attitudes toward the userbase, long-term intentions for the site,* **and** *restoring user confidence* **) to the final Reconciliation Proposal to the Ruqqus Admins.**\r\n\r\n@NothinWrong had some good ones to start off. I'll add to them as they come in.\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n* *Do the admins support the actions of users to drive away right-wingers, \"nazis\" and/or Voat users?*\r\n\r\n* *If not, will users who have done this face consequences for these actions?
