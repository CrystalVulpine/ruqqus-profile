Why did you start a free speech platform?*\r\n\r\n* *Do Ruqqus Admins maintain their commitment to free speech, privacy, transparency, and fairness? If so, will you continue to do so, as well as you can, even when you receive either public or private feedback against doing so?*\r\n\r\n* *Members of the Ruqqus user base believe that admins have made decisions based on feelings and personal dislike in the past. In an effort to prevent future occurrences of this, are you willing to add objectivity to your list of commitments?*\r\n\r\n* *Members of the Ruqqus user base feel that you are dismissive and that they no longer know your intentions for the platform.

Particularly, end all categorization based on \u201coffense,\u201d end categorization applied to +All, do not shadowban uncategorized guilds, and do not self-appoint roles to change guild or user settings.*\r\n\r\n9.  *End snap decision banning, offer 2 official warnings prior to ban, and implement a publicly viewable appeals process for banned and exiled users.*\r\n\r\n10. *Seek to prevent such contentious community issues in the future by hiring a marketing and community relations manager and by creating a functional distinction between those who set policy and those who enforce policy.*\r\n\r\n**Ruqqus Community**\r\n\r\nWhile we await a response, please keep in mind that this is a collaborative effort between the community and the admins.
