The users talking about it were saying that carp was allowed to use your account whenever he wants for anything, so if it was fake then wouldn't it be more like \"hey carp, I'm going to let you use my account because I don't want people to know you were added to the admin team because it would cause drama\"?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609350796, "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 1609351752, "fullname": "t3_lq1t", "guild_id": "16z", "herald_guild": null, "id": "lq1t", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 4, "parent_comment_id": ["lpxg"], "permalink": "/+The_Cabal/post/686f/whats-this-thing-about-carpathianflorist-using/lq1t", "post_id": "686f", "score": -1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["lq1t"], "permalink": "/+The_Cabal/post/686f/whats-this-thing-about-carpathianflorist-using/lq8c", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "I keep hearing that captainmeta4 lets carp use his account and even temp ban users.
