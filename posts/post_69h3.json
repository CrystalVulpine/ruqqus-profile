All criticism is considered harassment and now a crime.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not setting you up to be banned, I am giving you an opportunity to avoid getting banned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(can we all just admire what a golden statement that is coming from the retard admins)</p>\n<p>Attacking people for being in the Ruqqus Discord is not allowed. Stop criticizing us at once or you will be promptly banned. Also, any evidence of discord screenshots is fake if it's presented by the other side criticizing the RCP.
