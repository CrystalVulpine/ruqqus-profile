Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one). I don't want another Reddit...</p>\n<p>I'll lurk for a while (meaning I'll stop posting and creating content, stop/limit writing of comments). Even though Ruqqus is getting worse for some time, maybe there is still a chance admins see the light. I will be trying <a href=\"https://saidit.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">saidit</a> and possibly <a href=\"https://poal.co\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poal</a>, maybe I'll see you there.</p>\n<p>To prevent any rumors and mischaracterization (since I saw it done in several instances before):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am not a nazi (or any other extremist).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently). I created few Ruqqus-inspired pieces in Blender (each taking 1-2 work days, e.g. a <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/21c5/ruqqus-wallpaper-oc\">wallpaper</a> and some Ruqqies in <a href=\"/+Ruqqie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqie/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqie</a>), and of course created and maintained this userscript (that's at least a hundred work hours, probably much more; maintaining it over 5 months I believe).</li>\n<li>I am not a troll. I always tried to stay positive and polite (I like non-pc/dank/dark/edgy memes and don't mind vulgarities, but I don't use them).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes.

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes.

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently).

I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently).

It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on <a href=\"http://ruqqus.com\">ruqqus.com</a>). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25\">I wrote a comment about that problem recently</a> (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one). I don't want another Reddit...</p>\n<p>I'll lurk for a while (meaning I'll stop posting and creating content, stop/limit writing of comments).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently). I created few Ruqqus-inspired pieces in Blender (each taking 1-2 work days, e.g. a <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+Ruqqus/post/21c5/ruqqus-wallpaper-oc\">wallpaper</a> and some Ruqqies in <a href=\"/+Ruqqie\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 align-middle mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqie/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqie</a>), and of course created and maintained this userscript (that's at least a hundred work hours, probably much more; maintaining it over 5 months I believe).</li>\n<li>I am not a troll.

Some of their failures were fixed (censoring uncategorized guilds, arbitrary bans for threats), others were not (forced categories). I dislike how unprofessionally are admins  behaving - ignoring (or not even requesting) feedback from community, encouraging and participating in brigadding and trolling operations, banning people for criticism under the excuse of undefined harassment (this should be defined precisely and allowing as much as possible, same as happened to threats, or you are not a free speech platform; offended can use block) and banning (or at least threatening to ban) for off-platform behaviour (not on ruqqus.com). It looks like admins were even cooperating with a group on Discord, so that the group can steal guilds (siege with alts) within seconds after admins roll out rule changes. And using Discord instead of their own platform or at least a freespeech-supporting alternative (e.g. self-hosted Matrix), [I wrote a comment about that problem recently](https://ruqqus.com/+uslashremoved/post/695h/sfrohne-permanently-banned-for-linking-to/ly25) (but I mentioned it several times before, in a span of months, I wasn't the only one).

I started using Ruqqus over half a year ago and since then I posted a lot of links to videos I found interesting, majority of them apolitical (rest were about gaming and negative effects brought by mixing politics in). I tried to grow few apolitical guilds (I believe that without much better category system [quick switching between sets of categories] or multireddits/aliances, it's almost impossible currently).
