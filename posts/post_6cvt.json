This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.

Is God himself not exposing us all to that risk through the act of creation? If we deem in our own limited understanding that it would be better for someone to never be born, then are we not usurping God's authority and, in a way, trying to foil from the very outset the plans he has for those people? \n\n> Wouldn't it make us selfish and greedy if we saved children their lives and proceed to then threaten their salvation, just to save our own?\n\nThis is a foolish argument. Is it ever selfish and greedy to follow the commandments of God and the natural created order \u2014 even if it seems counterintuitive to us (Isa 55:9 As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.)? This is especially foolish when you realize that the reasons given _for_ aborting babies are selfishness and greed (\"I'm not ready\", \"It would be too hard\", \"It's not convenient right now\", \"I have to think of my career\", \"I can't afford it\", etc.). Furthermore, the Bible is pretty clear that we are not to commit evil acts even if the ends are good; the means are just as important as the ends.\n\nThis whole line of argumentation is about the same as one we could make for just killing someone as soon as they are saved (regardless of their age). I mean, why doesn't God himself just end our life as soon as our election is secured? To think that either is acceptable is to second guess God and try to usurp his authority, and to anyone that would still be struggling with these notions, perhaps we can only lean on the conclusion at then end of Ecclesiastes: 12:8 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d says the Teacher. \u201cEverything is meaningless!\u201d ... 13 Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. 14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.\n\nWhy do we not kill babies (or anyone with a right standing before God) in order to send them straight to heaven? Because God said so.\n\n> I have trouble coming to grips with that morally. It demotivates me to save children or care for them when it comes down to it as it seems a much greater mercy if they die.\n\nMorals are not in a vacuum (they are from God), and we often forget that we cannot see the big picture that God can. Perhaps you are saving that one person \u2014 even at the expense of your own damnation \u2014 but again, what are the effects of that one life going to be... perhaps by taking that one baby's life, you are condemning dozens or hundreds more to hell 40 years down the road. You don't know, and that's the point. We don't know the future, so it is to us to trust and obey God in the present, even when it may not make sense to us.\n\n> Beside that, life seems like a curse to babies growing up before Christ\n\nSo was everyone before Christ was born condemned to hell? No. There were still people justified by faith (Abraham is a good example) and Christ's sacrifice extended in both directions in human history.\n\n> and babies growing up in places where the gospel will never be heard of. \n\nAgain, we don't know the future. Will that child always remain in the area? Will that area never hear the Gospel? Will that child bring the gospel to that area? We don't know: obey God.\n\n> the main reasoning for believing babies to go to heaven is the fact everybody _wants_ this to be true because we have a special feeling towards babies\n\nNo. I would say that this argument is born from the fact that God is righteous and will not condemn people for anything but their own sins (Ezekiel 18). An individual human, then, who has not yet sinned would therefore _not_ be condemned by a righteous God. At what point would a child be capable of sin? I don't know \u2014 God knows. It's going to be different for every single person, and having young kids of my own, terrifies me that for every human there's likely a gap there where they are consciously sinning, but before they accept salvation \u2014 and why training up kids in the light of the gospel from birth is so important. To me, in order to believe that unborn infants would go to hell, you would have to believe in some form of the Roman Catholic version of original sin, which I do not. I believe that we are born with a fallen sinful _nature_, a propensity towards sin, but a _propensity_ towards sin is not sin itself any more than a mental or biological propensity towards alcoholism gets you drunk.\n\n> Is this truly fair reasoning though as it's arguably a primal instinct of ours to feel this way towards babies while not caring nearly as much about those not able to receive the Gospel due to circumstances?\n\nPart of our sanctification \u2014 becoming more Christlike \u2014 is to grow that feeling of deep concern for the lost. Why does it seem wrong or unfair that we care more about babies? Because it _is_ wrong and broken and unfair \u2014 and that's part of our sinful nature that has to be corrected. But these are two _different_ problems. Caring for the shedding of innocent blood on the one hand, and reaching out to the lost on the other. They are both critically important, but both require different responses and solutions \u2014 I would argue that it's kind of an apples and oranges comparison.\n\n> Aren't we too indulged in sinful pride when we can't fathom that human babies may be sinful from birth? Deciding that it would be unrighteous? Pride which partly covers us from God?\n\nNo. I would point back to the same argument in Eze 18. God is righteous and _has plainly said_ that he only condemns people for their own sins. You conscience, placed in you by God, should be telling you that this is right and fair.\n\n> Would you still follow God if you knew that he does condemn babies to hell?\n\nI would follow God because there is no other to follow. After reading Eze 18 (and thanks for provoking me to find that), I am 100% sure that God judges all fairly \u2014 regardless of their age. Anything more has to be left to trusting him.\n\n> The quotes concerning the law seem to me to be more of a warning that following the jewish law isn't a guarantee to heaven. \n\nYes, but the main point is what I bolded: all have sinned \u2014 not all are tainted by Adam's original sin, or a sin nature, or something like that \u2014 but all _have sinned_. It is by their individual sins that each individual person is condemned, and even the Jews, as righteous as they are, still have each individually, down to a person, committed sins. That's even part of the Romans 5:12 ... which indicates that a sin-nature (a propensity for sin) has entered the world, it is still each individual's sin that leads to death and condemnation: \"and so death passed upon all men, for that **all have sinned**.\"\n\n> What's also problematic is the fact that children become sinful very quickly as any parent can attest to I'm sure. At 3 year old they are for sure sinning in all kinds of ways, however they are yet incapable of taking the message of Christ to heart. Does this mean they are screwed when they die then no matter what? While they would have been saved if they died 2 years ago?\n\nI agree that this is scary. For what it's worth, I have seen people who have (claimed) to be saved as early as 4. None of the scariness or uncertainty during the early childhood years negates any of the arguments I made above, though. Yes, life in this crappy, evil, fallen world is full of uncertainty, unfairness, evil, and things that are scary.

If we deem in our own limited understanding that it would be better for someone to never be born, then are we not usurping God's authority and, in a way, trying to foil from the very outset the plans he has for those people?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wouldn't it make us selfish and greedy if we saved children their lives and proceed to then threaten their salvation, just to save our own?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a foolish argument. Is it ever selfish and greedy to follow the commandments of God and the natural created order \u2014 even if it seems counterintuitive to us (Isa 55:9 As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.)? This is especially foolish when you realize that the reasons given <em>for</em> aborting babies are selfishness and greed (\"I'm not ready\", \"It would be too hard\", \"It's not convenient right now\", \"I have to think of my career\", \"I can't afford it\", etc.). Furthermore, the Bible is pretty clear that we are not to commit evil acts even if the ends are good; the means are just as important as the ends.</p>\n<p>This whole line of argumentation is about the same as one we could make for just killing someone as soon as they are saved (regardless of their age). I mean, why doesn't God himself just end our life as soon as our election is secured? To think that either is acceptable is to second guess God and try to usurp his authority, and to anyone that would still be struggling with these notions, perhaps we can only lean on the conclusion at then end of Ecclesiastes: 12:8 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d says the Teacher. \u201cEverything is meaningless!\u201d ... 13 Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. 14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</p>\n<p>Why do we not kill babies (or anyone with a right standing before God) in order to send them straight to heaven? Because God said so.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have trouble coming to grips with that morally. It demotivates me to save children or care for them when it comes down to it as it seems a much greater mercy if they die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Morals are not in a vacuum (they are from God), and we often forget that we cannot see the big picture that God can. Perhaps you are saving that one person \u2014 even at the expense of your own damnation \u2014 but again, what are the effects of that one life going to be... perhaps by taking that one baby's life, you are condemning dozens or hundreds more to hell 40 years down the road. You don't know, and that's the point. We don't know the future, so it is to us to trust and obey God in the present, even when it may not make sense to us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beside that, life seems like a curse to babies growing up before Christ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So was everyone before Christ was born condemned to hell? No. There were still people justified by faith (Abraham is a good example) and Christ's sacrifice extended in both directions in human history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and babies growing up in places where the gospel will never be heard of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, we don't know the future. Will that child always remain in the area? Will that area never hear the Gospel? Will that child bring the gospel to that area? We don't know: obey God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the main reasoning for believing babies to go to heaven is the fact everybody <em>wants</em> this to be true because we have a special feeling towards babies</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. I would say that this argument is born from the fact that God is righteous and will not condemn people for anything but their own sins (Ezekiel 18). An individual human, then, who has not yet sinned would therefore <em>not</em> be condemned by a righteous God. At what point would a child be capable of sin? I don't know \u2014 God knows. It's going to be different for every single person, and having young kids of my own, terrifies me that for every human there's likely a gap there where they are consciously sinning, but before they accept salvation \u2014 and why training up kids in the light of the gospel from birth is so important. To me, in order to believe that unborn infants would go to hell, you would have to believe in some form of the Roman Catholic version of original sin, which I do not. I believe that we are born with a fallen sinful <em>nature</em>, a propensity towards sin, but a <em>propensity</em> towards sin is not sin itself any more than a mental or biological propensity towards alcoholism gets you drunk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this truly fair reasoning though as it's arguably a primal instinct of ours to feel this way towards babies while not caring nearly as much about those not able to receive the Gospel due to circumstances?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Part of our sanctification \u2014 becoming more Christlike \u2014 is to grow that feeling of deep concern for the lost. Why does it seem wrong or unfair that we care more about babies? Because it <em>is</em> wrong and broken and unfair \u2014 and that's part of our sinful nature that has to be corrected. But these are two <em>different</em> problems. Caring for the shedding of innocent blood on the one hand, and reaching out to the lost on the other. They are both critically important, but both require different responses and solutions \u2014 I would argue that it's kind of an apples and oranges comparison.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aren't we too indulged in sinful pride when we can't fathom that human babies may be sinful from birth? Deciding that it would be unrighteous? Pride which partly covers us from God?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. I would point back to the same argument in Eze 18. God is righteous and <em>has plainly said</em> that he only condemns people for their own sins. You conscience, placed in you by God, should be telling you that this is right and fair.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would you still follow God if you knew that he does condemn babies to hell?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would follow God because there is no other to follow. After reading Eze 18 (and thanks for provoking me to find that), I am 100% sure that God judges all fairly \u2014 regardless of their age. Anything more has to be left to trusting him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The quotes concerning the law seem to me to be more of a warning that following the jewish law isn't a guarantee to heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, but the main point is what I bolded: all have sinned \u2014 not all are tainted by Adam's original sin, or a sin nature, or something like that \u2014 but all <em>have sinned</em>. It is by their individual sins that each individual person is condemned, and even the Jews, as righteous as they are, still have each individually, down to a person, committed sins. That's even part of the Romans 5:12 ... which indicates that a sin-nature (a propensity for sin) has entered the world, it is still each individual's sin that leads to death and condemnation: \"and so death passed upon all men, for that <strong>all have sinned</strong>.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What's also problematic is the fact that children become sinful very quickly as any parent can attest to I'm sure. At 3 year old they are for sure sinning in all kinds of ways, however they are yet incapable of taking the message of Christ to heart. Does this mean they are screwed when they die then no matter what? While they would have been saved if they died 2 years ago?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree that this is scary. For what it's worth, I have seen people who have (claimed) to be saved as early as 4. None of the scariness or uncertainty during the early childhood years negates any of the arguments I made above, though. Yes, life in this crappy, evil, fallen world is full of uncertainty, unfairness, evil, and things that are scary.

The Holy Spirit was the dominant force and the body was his servant. However, after Adam sinned, body became dominant and Adam his connection was cut from God, and because of this he met with death. Not only Adam, but all of his offspring were cut from God and were no longer born in God's image, but in their own likeness as a man of nature and with mind of flesh into death. What Christ did was offer the immense grace of restoring this bond with God. Trough the Holy Spirit we may again be in direct connection with God and thus be saved. \n\nAgain, we are no longer born in God's image, our very (spiritual) being has changed after Adam's sin. This would lead me to believe there's no reason babies would be saved as man had changed fundamentally in image and the Spirit simply isn't there.

For the judgment which  came from one offense  resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which  came from many offenses resulted in justification. For if by the one man\u2019s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)\nRomans 5:12\u202d-\u202c17 NKJV</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see, Adam initially had the Holy Spirit and was directly in connection with God in eternal life. The Holy Spirit was the dominant force and the body was his servant. However, after Adam sinned, body became dominant and Adam his connection was cut from God, and because of this he met with death. Not only Adam, but all of his offspring were cut from God and were no longer born in God's image, but in their own likeness as a man of nature and with mind of flesh into death. What Christ did was offer the immense grace of restoring this bond with God. Trough the Holy Spirit we may again be in direct connection with God and thus be saved.</p>\n<p>Again, we are no longer born in God's image, our very (spiritual) being has changed after Adam's sin. This would lead me to believe there's no reason babies would be saved as man had changed fundamentally in image and the Spirit simply isn't there. If babies <em>would</em> be saved it would be a direct intervention from God and an exception to the rule it seems since they naturally don't have a connection to God, and it's not the same way Christ may have saved the chosen people from before His time since that has already happened, which was a 1 time event I assume?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1609877181, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_mbi7", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1583035818, "description": "\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

I mean, why doesn't God himself just end our life as soon as our election is secured? To think that either is acceptable is to second guess God and try to usurp his authority, and to anyone that would still be struggling with these notions, perhaps we can only lean on the conclusion at then end of Ecclesiastes: 12:8 \u201cMeaningless!

Because God said so.\n\n> I have trouble coming to grips with that morally. It demotivates me to save children or care for them when it comes down to it as it seems a much greater mercy if they die.\n\nMorals are not in a vacuum (they are from God), and we often forget that we cannot see the big picture that God can. Perhaps you are saving that one person \u2014 even at the expense of your own damnation \u2014 but again, what are the effects of that one life going to be... perhaps by taking that one baby's life, you are condemning dozens or hundreds more to hell 40 years down the road. You don't know, and that's the point. We don't know the future, so it is to us to trust and obey God in the present, even when it may not make sense to us.\n\n> Beside that, life seems like a curse to babies growing up before Christ\n\nSo was everyone before Christ was born condemned to hell? No. There were still people justified by faith (Abraham is a good example) and Christ's sacrifice extended in both directions in human history.\n\n> and babies growing up in places where the gospel will never be heard of. \n\nAgain, we don't know the future. Will that child always remain in the area? Will that area never hear the Gospel? Will that child bring the gospel to that area? We don't know: obey God.\n\n> the main reasoning for believing babies to go to heaven is the fact everybody _wants_ this to be true because we have a special feeling towards babies\n\nNo. I would say that this argument is born from the fact that God is righteous and will not condemn people for anything but their own sins (Ezekiel 18). An individual human, then, who has not yet sinned would therefore _not_ be condemned by a righteous God. At what point would a child be capable of sin? I don't know \u2014 God knows. It's going to be different for every single person, and having young kids of my own, terrifies me that for every human there's likely a gap there where they are consciously sinning, but before they accept salvation \u2014 and why training up kids in the light of the gospel from birth is so important. To me, in order to believe that unborn infants would go to hell, you would have to believe in some form of the Roman Catholic version of original sin, which I do not. I believe that we are born with a fallen sinful _nature_, a propensity towards sin, but a _propensity_ towards sin is not sin itself any more than a mental or biological propensity towards alcoholism gets you drunk.\n\n> Is this truly fair reasoning though as it's arguably a primal instinct of ours to feel this way towards babies while not caring nearly as much about those not able to receive the Gospel due to circumstances?\n\nPart of our sanctification \u2014 becoming more Christlike \u2014 is to grow that feeling of deep concern for the lost. Why does it seem wrong or unfair that we care more about babies? Because it _is_ wrong and broken and unfair \u2014 and that's part of our sinful nature that has to be corrected. But these are two _different_ problems. Caring for the shedding of innocent blood on the one hand, and reaching out to the lost on the other. They are both critically important, but both require different responses and solutions \u2014 I would argue that it's kind of an apples and oranges comparison.\n\n> Aren't we too indulged in sinful pride when we can't fathom that human babies may be sinful from birth? Deciding that it would be unrighteous? Pride which partly covers us from God?\n\nNo. I would point back to the same argument in Eze 18. God is righteous and _has plainly said_ that he only condemns people for their own sins. You conscience, placed in you by God, should be telling you that this is right and fair.\n\n> Would you still follow God if you knew that he does condemn babies to hell?\n\nI would follow God because there is no other to follow. After reading Eze 18 (and thanks for provoking me to find that), I am 100% sure that God judges all fairly \u2014 regardless of their age. Anything more has to be left to trusting him.\n\n> The quotes concerning the law seem to me to be more of a warning that following the jewish law isn't a guarantee to heaven. \n\nYes, but the main point is what I bolded: all have sinned \u2014 not all are tainted by Adam's original sin, or a sin nature, or something like that \u2014 but all _have sinned_. It is by their individual sins that each individual person is condemned, and even the Jews, as righteous as they are, still have each individually, down to a person, committed sins. That's even part of the Romans 5:12 ... which indicates that a sin-nature (a propensity for sin) has entered the world, it is still each individual's sin that leads to death and condemnation: \"and so death passed upon all men, for that **all have sinned**.\"\n\n> What's also problematic is the fact that children become sinful very quickly as any parent can attest to I'm sure. At 3 year old they are for sure sinning in all kinds of ways, however they are yet incapable of taking the message of Christ to heart. Does this mean they are screwed when they die then no matter what? While they would have been saved if they died 2 years ago?\n\nI agree that this is scary. For what it's worth, I have seen people who have (claimed) to be saved as early as 4. None of the scariness or uncertainty during the early childhood years negates any of the arguments I made above, though.
