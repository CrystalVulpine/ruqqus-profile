The politicians do not care about you. Anyone pushing political solutions is trying (knowingly or not) to keep you unproductive and locked in the matrix. There isn't much we can do to stop the train barreling forward that is the coming technocracy/deep state agenda/Great Reset/whatever you want to call it. Step in front of the train and you will get crushed.\r\n\r\nYou can't control what happens a thousand miles away somewhere in the world. However, what you can do is take control of your own life so that you can thrive in the times to come. You may want to strategically relocate to an area where you can effectively implement these things. The cities are the most controlled places. There are many concrete steps you can take to ensure that you are resistant to the means of control used by TPTB. They control these things such as the centralized systems of food, money, and communication, in order to control the population, and if you are dependent of their systems, you are controllable. So, the logical thing to do is become independent of these systems. Self-sufficiency is the way to be free. (But careful about being the \"lone wolf\". Community is important too.)\r\n\r\n## Food\r\nGrow your own food. Not only is it healthier than the stuff you get at the supermarket, but because you produce your own, you are less vulnerable to food shortages, whether natural or engineered. The majority of food consumed by people comes from highly centralized farms and distribution companies. This is a very fragile system. TPTB could engineer a shortage to make people more dependent on (and therefore controllable) by government. There is also the potential moving forward for access to food to be gated by vaccine passports. There is already talk of using them for hospitals and public transportation. Supermarkets could be next.\r\n\r\n## Money\r\nDon't rely on centralized currencies. The money supply is centralized by the banks and government. The value of fiat currency is being dragged down by the endless printing of more and more money. The majority of money is already digital, and once the government rolls out its new CBDC (central bank digital currency) that they have been planning, and outlaws cash transactions, then every single purchase made can be tracked and could be denied if the government decides that you did something it doesn't like. Look at how credit card companies such as Visa blacklisting Gab and Discover banning GiveSendGo for just a taste of what the cashless future could look like. China, with its digital money and social credit system, has pretty much already implemented this.\r\n\r\nSolutions to this problem include decentralized cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and bartering. Not gonna lie, it's going to be difficult to do this when the general public are all using the CBDC and they won't want to take your crypto. You don't have to stop using the centralized currency altogether. Just don't rely totally on it for your well-being. That's why community is important. Building a community of people who understand the value of alternative currencies will make life easier.\r\n\r\n## Communication\r\nIt's no coincidence that just a handful of telecoms control pretty much the entire internet infrastructure and just as few companies control the major social media platforms. I'm sure you're all very aware of the censorship that occurs on the controlled platforms. That's why decentralized platforms such as Mastodon, as well as decentralized protocols such as IPFS are so important. We still haven't solved the decentralized infrastructure problem yet, but some projects like pkt.cash are trying to do that. \r\n\r\n## Everything else\r\nThere are many more solutions out there than what I have listed here.
