Learn to sew, learn to cook, just learn some basic skills to build up your own self-sufficiency and get off of Walmart and McDonald's teet. They don't need anymore $$$. Indoor farming is possible too, and rewarding. \n- Drop Hollywood. No more streaming, no movies, do not support cable networks and give them ratings. They peddle degeneracy 24/7. The lost in our country lap it up, but we don't have to participate.\n- Drop major sports. They don't deserve the time or attention we give them, so they can turn around and lecture us about race-relations and public policy. They're already hurting, shown by viewership decline, revenue drops, and the option of advertising on uniforms where there wasn't previously. \n- Meet your neighbors.

It does not make you free. It only wants to feed itself, no matter who's in charge. Wake up and make yourself free. Help someone learn that they can be free.

Indoor farming is possible too, and rewarding. \n- Drop Hollywood. No more streaming, no movies, do not support cable networks and give them ratings. They peddle degeneracy 24/7.

It does not make you free. It only wants to feed itself, no matter who's in charge. Wake up and make yourself free. Help someone learn that they can be free. God wants your heart and mind free, not tied up in worry and despair every day of your life. We have a positive impact we can make all around us, we just need to take off the blinders first. \n\nLast thing: worry about your salvation first. Then your family's. Then your neighbor's.

Buy local when possible. Learn to sew, learn to cook, just learn some basic skills to build up your own self-sufficiency and get off of Walmart and McDonald's teet. They don't need anymore $$$. Indoor farming is possible too, and rewarding.</li>\n<li>Drop Hollywood. No more streaming, no movies, do not support cable networks and give them ratings. They peddle degeneracy 24/7. The lost in our country lap it up, but we don't have to participate.</li>\n<li>Drop major sports. They don't deserve the time or attention we give them, so they can turn around and lecture us about race-relations and public policy. They're already hurting, shown by viewership decline, revenue drops, and the option of advertising on uniforms where there wasn't previously.</li>\n<li>Meet your neighbors. Build a community of Christ-like love and support for them. My neighbors barely speak English, but we share food and laughs and watch each other's backs 24/7.</li>\n<li>Build some wealth, and focus on personal responsibility. Do not worship debt and credit. Free yourself to prosper if you need to drop everything and move. I have worked on this for 3 years straight. It's not easy, but it's infinitely rewarding and liberating. I own my car. I have no credit card debt. I have a savings account that will help my wife and I live comfortably for at least 6 months, should things get wild. This took prayer, patience and discipline to achieve, but we're there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Money and knowledge is power. When certain people wield and misuse that power, you get the past 80-100 years of what we've seen our country decline into....the central government is not your parent. It does not make you secure. It does not make you free. It only wants to feed itself, no matter who's in charge. Wake up and make yourself free. Help someone learn that they can be free. God wants your heart and mind free, not tied up in worry and despair every day of your life. We have a positive impact we can make all around us, we just need to take off the blinders first.</p>\n<p>Last thing: worry about your salvation first. Then your family's. Then your neighbor's. Do not compromise your beliefs for an ever-shifting clownworld of morals. Your roots need to be nurtured every day, so there's nothing an antichrist can do to come along and uproot you. And antichrists are all around us. They need to be exposed and avoided.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1610125431, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_mn2m", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "mn2m", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6h0o/i-hope-for-a-day-where/mn2m", "post_id": "6h0o", "score": 9, "upvotes": 9, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["mn2m"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6h0o/i-hope-for-a-day-where/mnm8", "post": {"author_name": "ArchibaldCoolstep", "award_count": 0, "body": "I hope in time, Christians can reform themselves into self-sustaining communities and are subservient to no one but Christ.

There is nothing worth fighting for in a system that is inherently anti-Christ.</p>\n<p>Just as those in the early Church, I hope Christians will come to resist by no longer participating.  No more voting, no more taking out loans, no more paying taxes, no more consumption of media.</p>\n", "comment_count": 19, "created_utc": 1610117561, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_6h0o", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "6h0o", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6h0o/i-hope-for-a-day-where", "score": 17, "thumb_url": null, "title": "I hope for a day where Christians will abandon their governments", "upvotes": 17, "url": ""}, "post_id": "6h0o", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
