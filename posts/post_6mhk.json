But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.\r\n> \r\n> 2 Peter 2:20-22\r\n\r\n2 Peter is a forgery that teaches false doctrines. While it is true that the one who has knowledge of the truth and rejects it is worse off than before (blasphemy of the Holy Spirit) it is only through deliberate rejection and contempt that this is the case, not by slipping up as you seem to think.\r\n\r\n> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\r\n> \r\n> Matthew 7:21\r\n\r\nYes, by having a change of heart which also means you will naturally follow the commandments. Not your legalistic nonsense. In fact, if you are only obeying to \"get into heaven\" and not out of heart, you are not obeying them at all!\r\n\r\n> Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\r\n> \r\n> Luke 13:23-24\r\n\r\nYes, the ones pleading their WORKS as the reason to enter.\r\n\r\n> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\r\n> \r\n> James 2:19-20\r\n\r\nJames is a forgery and it's clearly written by Jews who wanted to revert Christianity back to their system of works salvation. Jesus is barely even mentioned in the whole right-strawy epistle.\r\n\r\nLook, I can play this game too!\r\n\r\n> To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. **He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.** For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”\r\n\r\n> **All things are lawful to me**, but not all things do benefit. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be mastered by anything.\r\n\r\n> When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” The centurion replied, “**Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof**. But just say the word, and my servant\\* will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “**Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.** But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.\r\n\r\n\\* very likely the centurion's *catamite* (ΠΑΙΣ). If that is indeed the case then the point of this story is made even stronger, as we can no longer twist \"I do not deserve to have you come under my roof\" into merely a humble statement.\r\n\r\n> Many will say to me on that day, ‘**Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?**’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: Guess I'm too much for you eh?\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ruqqus.com/post/6nfg/6EqnJcQLPxs)","body_html":"<p>One more thing, some of this is just ridiculous.

In fact, if you are only obeying to \"get into heaven\" and not out of heart, you are not obeying them at all!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p>\n<p>Luke 13:23-24</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the ones pleading their WORKS as the reason to enter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>\n<p>James 2:19-20</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>James is a forgery and it's clearly written by Jews who wanted to revert Christianity back to their system of works salvation. Jesus is barely even mentioned in the whole right-strawy epistle.</p>\n<p>Look, I can play this game too!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ But the tax collector stood at a distance. <strong>He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.</strong> For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>All things are lawful to me</strong>, but not all things do benefit. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be mastered by anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” The centurion replied, “<strong>Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof</strong>. But just say the word, and my servant* will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “<strong>Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</strong> But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>* very likely the centurion's <em>catamite</em> (ΠΑΙΣ). If that is indeed the case then the point of this story is made even stronger, as we can no longer twist \"I do not deserve to have you come under my roof\" into merely a humble statement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many will say to me on that day, ‘**Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?**’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Edit: Guess I'm too much for you eh?</p>\n<p><a data-target=\"#expandImageModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/6nfg/6EqnJcQLPxs\" onclick=\"expandDesktopImage('https://i.ruqqus.com/post/6nfg/6EqnJcQLPxs');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"in-comment-image rounded-sm my-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" src=\"https://i.ruqqus.com/post/6nfg/6EqnJcQLPxs\" style=\"max-height: 100px; max-width: 100%;\"/></a></p>\n","created_utc":1610561940,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1610570146,"fullname":"t3_nesq","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1583035818,"description":"\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
