In fact, if what you said was true then the verses that indicate God has set authorities over the nations would make God a liar. God, and Jesus, tell us that while we are on this earth we are subject to the laws and authorities here so long as they do not violate the laws of God. The Jews lived in Egypt under the pharaoh without issue until pharaoh began to crush them under the weight of slavery, after which God sent someone to free them, both to fulfill the prophecy of taking them to the promised land but also because he would not let his people live under oppression. GOD sent someone to instigate the rebellion of the people to escape slavery.\n\nAnd when we speak of authorities of nations I don't think we can speak of specific people IN MOST CASES. God is the creator of the nations, but man has free will to choose those to whom they hand the mantle of leadership to, though God may appoint certain people for a purpose. Did God raise up pharaoh? No, I don't think so. God raised up Egypt. Egypt chose their leaders in the manner they use. Eventually a pharaoh got nervous bout the Jews and decided to place them under slavery. The Jews cried out and God chose Moses to be his hand and free the people. He hardened the heart of pharaoh so that the Jews, and Egypt, could witness the power of God.\n\nDid God set up Hitler or Stalin? No. God established the creation of Germany and Russia, but men have free will to do as they please and choose their leaders as they please. Men have free will to do evil and subjugate others. Men also have free will to fight against tyranny and oppression. Many people think God has every action of every person mapped out and that we cannot go off script, but this is antithetical to God's love for mankind, which is free will. We may call upon him and he may intervene, but we are not puppets on strings that he controls from heaven above.\n\nHere in the Americas (I do not know if you are American or not) the founding fathers recognized the divine hand of God making it possible for them to fight and win against the most powerful military force on earth at the time, against a king who was for oppressing them. Perhaps it was Gods divine plan to set up the United States for the future of the worlds sake during the World Wars, or perhaps it was just Gods response to a people who recognized him, worshipped him, followed the statues laid out in his word and called upon him for his divine hand to grant them victory.\n\nThis sound like where our impasse lies.
