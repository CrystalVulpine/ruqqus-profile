Do you deny the existence of people with retardation disorders? Can you seriously expect an ant to become as smart as a person by sheer will? No you can't. Nurture helps but it still depends on nature. It makes perfect sense biologically, everyone serves a different task in a tribe or society and is optimized for that role. The problem is, this is outdated now. Less than 200 years ago, you carried on your family legacy because that's what you were good at, whether you liked it or not. Some families farmed, because that's what they were good at. Some families entered trades they were good at. Others ran business or became politicians and lawyers, because they were good at that. Men did physical labor and fighting, or less often leading, because that's what they were good at. Women did intellectual and creative things, and raised children, because that's what they were good at. People are social animals, and you are optimized to serve your tribe above all else. So each person is specialized for certain tasks, and other functions are nerfed because they get in the way of the role they're suppose to do.

As a social animal, your genes don't give a flying fuck about you, they only care about the tribe, and you only matter as far as you will benefit it. It's literally fucking communism.
