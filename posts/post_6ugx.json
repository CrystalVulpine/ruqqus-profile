What happened to small government, individual liberty, free markets, free speech, and the constitution? It seems you've become obsessed and fixated with nothing but beating the other side lately, and have been resorting to authoritarian means to do so. Are you even conservatives anymore? I wouldn't say so, because this new philosophy doesn't at all align with founding values.</p>\n<p>Lately I've seen a lot of comments saying certain people should be banned from being able to hold office, serve in the military, or even be censored (<a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+Conservative/post/6ube/joe-biden-taps-transgender-official-as\">this thread </a> alone has many examples). I've even seen a few complaining about how there's too much diversity and that's our problem (it used to be <em>forced</em> diversity that was complained about, because it's annoying PC crap). Even the sidebar of this guild says \"no egalitarianism\", which used to be one of the constitutional pillars for conservatives, \"all men are created equal\" (to clarify: in the sense of equality, not equity). Support for limited government, individual rights, equality under the law, and free markets is waning. None of this was happening until about a year ago. Up until then, conservatives could be defined as rooted in the moderately libertarian founding values of the USA, with some republic thrown in as necessary. That's definitely not true anymore. Many conservatives had strong beliefs but it was vital that they not be forced on others like the Democrats do, especially by the government. But now many of you want just that. If I had seen conservatives just 5 years ago I wouldn't even recognize you now. What the fuck happened?
