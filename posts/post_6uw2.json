I know some youtube people don't think \"all churches are businesses and want your money\", but I think they end up like that. As soon as a church starts to buy property and equipment and take on a staff then keeping money in the coffers becomes a high priority, and Christ can get pushed to the back shelf. And he does, because we see Western churches catering to their best customers! Women! Men don't spend a ton of money on religious stuff. A bible and maybe some studies. Women spend far more AND control where the money goes in a lot of homes. When you pay 10k a month in expenses you need to keep those tithes rolling in! The church I spoke of above once sent out letters urging people to tithe because they needed $120,000 to be in the black for the year! I also do their computer work (I still like some of the people there, just not the way the church is run) and they told me they had budgeted $12,000 to upgrade their network!

I know some youtube people don't think \"all churches are businesses and want your money\", but I think they end up like that. As soon as a church starts to buy property and equipment and take on a staff then keeping money in the coffers becomes a high priority, and Christ can get pushed to the back shelf. And he does, because we see Western churches catering to their best customers! Women! Men don't spend a ton of money on religious stuff. A bible and maybe some studies. Women spend far more AND control where the money goes in a lot of homes. When you pay 10k a month in expenses you need to keep those tithes rolling in!

Women ascribe to \"experience\" more than men do and are more sympathetic to perceived injustice and slights, ergo, the church has adopted the culture as a baseline for what is right and filters scripture through it where they can. In places where they cannot, ie: really bad sins like murder, they stand, but society as a whole also sees those things as bad. Things like abortion, divorce and adultery get a pass, though, because they are widely accepted by society as a whole, mostly by women, and scripture can be twisted to support them, or ignored where need be.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1611103147, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_o6el", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "o6el", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["o65i"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6uw2/nae-denounces-insurrection-at-the-us/o6el", "post_id": "6uw2", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["o6el"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6uw2/nae-denounces-insurrection-at-the-us/o8bi", "post": {"author_name": "DeltaTango", "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 20, "created_utc": 1611099209, "domain": "byfaithonline.com", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_6uw2", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "6uw2", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/6uw2/nae-denounces-insurrection-at-the-us", "score": -1, "thumb_url": null, "title": "NAE Denounces Insurrection at the U.S. Capitol", "upvotes": 1, "url": "https://byfaithonline.com/nae-denounces-insurrection-at-the-u-s-capitol/"}, "post_id": "6uw2", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
