Not the forgeries James, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, and Jude, probably 1 & 2 Peter, Hebrews, Colossians, Ephesians, and 2 Thessalonians (and possibly Revelation and the Johannine epistles). Or the obvious additions to Paul's letters especially in 1 Corinthians. I never said I didn't believe, but the bible != the word and that is just everyone's misguided assumption (the real word is very clearly identified at the beginning of John, and it's not the bible--so if you think it's the bible, you ironically don't believe the bible). People jump through many confusing hoops to try and get them not to contradict everything else even though all the places that do that are the ones that have a lot of evidence of not being written by who they say they were. That they were forgeries is pretty obvious and makes way more sense than a confusing mess of twisting opposing passages to agree with each other. There's also the possibility that even a true author is simply wrong about something. I mean come on, even the closest disciples were called fools more than anyone else and were absolutely clueless most of the time, can you really trust them 100%? These writings are good for reading but people barely even read the gospels, and they're the ones that literally document everything we need to know. Putting humans on the same level of authority especially when there are malicious forgeries among them creates tons of confusion and contradictions, perverting the very simple message found in all 4 gospels, and that is what we are told to follow, not \"the bible\" that wasn't even put together until 400 years later. Everything in the bible makes so much more sense when you realize this.

Not the forgeries James, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Titus, and Jude, probably 1 &amp; 2 Peter, Hebrews, Colossians, Ephesians, and 2 Thessalonians (and possibly Revelation and the Johannine epistles). Or the obvious additions to Paul's letters especially in 1 Corinthians. I never said I didn't believe, but the bible != the word and that is just everyone's misguided assumption (the real word is very clearly identified at the beginning of John, and it's not the bible--so if you think it's the bible, you ironically don't believe the bible). People jump through many confusing hoops to try and get them not to contradict everything else even though all the places that do that are the ones that have a lot of evidence of not being written by who they say they were. That they were forgeries is pretty obvious and makes way more sense than a confusing mess of twisting opposing passages to agree with each other. There's also the possibility that even a true author is simply wrong about something. I mean come on, even the closest disciples were called fools more than anyone else and were absolutely clueless most of the time, can you really trust them 100%? These writings are good for reading but people barely even read the gospels, and they're the ones that literally document everything we need to know.
