Obviously if you have 1000 boys and only 100 girls there will be more of everything from the boys. So yeah there are more male geniuses because they have a higher participation in that, but the few women top them. If you limit your sample to girls who act like they're from the same planet as us I guarantee you they will be the smarter ones (just look at ruqqus even, @sfrohne, @no_chill, @stars_in_blue_major, @LlamaBean, @AngstKitten, @Madje, etc; ruqqus is more attractive to men so the girly girls won't use it. But with a mostly male userbase I think the top users may even have a slight female majority, simply because they're generally more talented than the guys. Even the ones who aren't top users are still usually smarter and more creative, they just aren't as active (ex. @gaycuttlefish). Another difference I've noted is that some of them produce their own content quite often while the guys almost never do, nor can they produce acceptable results (I've tried). I don't think it's an accident that all the creative endeavors are looked upon as feminine). Brain scans have shown that men not only have less of a brain (especially on the right side) but don't even use as many of the functions they do have. Men are made for laboring, providing, leading, and fighting, which means that they will have good strategy ability as it relates to those tasks but that's about it, everything else is severely limited as it would get in the way. This is kind of obsolete in modern society but men still haven't adapted. It essentially boils down to the hard work vs talent debate, men are usually more hard working but the women have more raw talent. If the latter doesn't work hard then the former will be able to beat them, but if it works even a little bit hard the former will be working their tail off and not even come close.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I never denied that men and women are fundamentally different, that's literally my whole point.

Nearly every single time one of them is actually productive they excel ahead of the men. In every school and college I've seen the girls in the advanced classes have no trouble solving some of the problems that absolutely stump the guys, even though there's more of the latter. Obviously if you have 1000 boys and only 100 girls there will be more of everything from the boys. So yeah there are more male geniuses because they have a higher participation in that, but the few women top them. If you limit your sample to girls who act like they're from the same planet as us I guarantee you they will be the smarter ones (just look at ruqqus even, @sfrohne, @no_chill, @stars_in_blue_major, @LlamaBean, @AngstKitten, @Madje, etc; ruqqus is more attractive to men so the girly girls won't use it. But with a mostly male userbase I think the top users may even have a slight female majority, simply because they're generally more talented than the guys. Even the ones who aren't top users are still usually smarter and more creative, they just aren't as active (ex. @gaycuttlefish). Another difference I've noted is that some of them produce their own content quite often while the guys almost never do, nor can they produce acceptable results (I've tried). I don't think it's an accident that all the creative endeavors are looked upon as feminine). Brain scans have shown that men not only have less of a brain (especially on the right side) but don't even use as many of the functions they do have. Men are made for laboring, providing, leading, and fighting, which means that they will have good strategy ability as it relates to those tasks but that's about it, everything else is severely limited as it would get in the way. This is kind of obsolete in modern society but men still haven't adapted. It essentially boils down to the hard work vs talent debate, men are usually more hard working but the women have more raw talent. If the latter doesn't work hard then the former will be able to beat them, but if it works even a little bit hard the former will be working their tail off and not even come close.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I never denied that men and women are fundamentally different, that's literally my whole point.

It was not uncommon for a husband to present and assume credit for his wife's work because otherwise it wouldn't have been allowed. On top of that men are more likely to pursue monetary success and fame because of their desire to lead and much larger competitive edge, which means naturally they become more well known, whereas women are more likely to engage in something just for fun and personal pleasure.
