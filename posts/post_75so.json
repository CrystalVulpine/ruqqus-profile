I just thought it'd be funny to prove almost everyone wrong.\n\nyou're not proving anyone wrong though\n\n> But the \"simple\" explanation is, if you're in a car, you know from being outside that cars move, but observe that from inside the car, it is actually the world zooming past you; otherwise the movement would push you against the seat the same way someone outside getting hit with the car would, but instead you don't move or even feel the pressure to slide back\n\nHumans dont feel movement. The thing we're able to feel is acceleration, that's why we feel different when the car is accelerating (+-) compared to when the speed is constant. It's the same thing with our inner ear being able to hear which way is down because of gravity. When we are in a moving car, we are moving at almost the same rate as the car, i.e. the relative speed between us and the car would be around 0. \n\nThe car brought us up to that speed, and if it were to abruptly stop we would find ourselves being flung forward because we would not have slowed down, only the car.\n\n>  it is actually the world zooming past you\n\nthis is philosophy, not scientific.\n\n> And even spills and dust and feathers fall straight down inside, proving that it is the world around you moving and the car remains stationary\n\nshort answer: no. \n\ngo ahead, get inside the car with your favourite drink, feel yourself being accelerated. When you reach a constant speed, spill your favourite drink between the front seats and see it fly back to the back seats. When the liquid is in the cup it has potential energy, when you pour it out it has kinetic energy. but only at the spot you poured it out on. It itself has not been affected by the cars movement. It moves in the direction of gravity, it's not trying to behave like a pet and obey your orders of it having to be spilled out underneath the cup.\n\n> And even spills and dust and feathers fall straight down inside, proving that it is the world around you moving and the car remains stationary\n\nIf we're going to play the gender game like you do later on in your text, then sure. My feeble female brain cannot understand what you're trying to prove here. \n\n> Majority seems to rule and you accept that this is just an illusion, but it's actually not. It's simply two different perspectives.\n\nMajority? Maybe there is something to it then if it's the majority rule. Just as theres something to the \"bluepill\" if everyone you met told you the same exact things. X. \n\nThe reason we find cars to be moving when we're walking on the pavement outside is because we are moving at a slower speed than them. The the same thing when we find other cars being stationary on the road when in reality they're just moving at a slower rate than our vehicle. \n\n> Any point you select to compare movement against will always be in the center, fixed and stationary, because it's literally your point of comparison.\n\nHow about I tell you that nothing is fixed and stationary. Galaxies roam, love. We perceive it as such because we are moving at the same speed the object is. And we're moving at the same speed the earth is. My IKEA wardrobe seems to be stationary but it is moving the same speed as the Earth. It doesnt matter what perspective we see it from. If my wardrobe was the centre, how come the Milky Way isn't orbiting around it?\n\n> In fact, in programming when rendering 3D worlds you do not have any \"camera\" to move around, as it's always on screen; instead you move the world itself. The same applies to the earth and the sun. This is why we don't feel the earth moving or get thrown off of it, because from our own point of reference it's not moving at all.\n\nOn the contrary, when I am using CAD I am moving the camera around the object(s). They're stationary on a plane. If I moved them, then the measurement plane would have to move as well, using a lot more of the computer's power which is unessecary.\n\n>  But if you stand on the sun, earth is moving around it and rotating.\n\nFirst off, I was standing on the sun I would be dead, even if I stood on a coldspot.\n\nThe reason I would perceive it as such is because it *is*. If I stood at the centre of the Milky Way, I would perceive the sun to be rotating around that point, because it *is*. The largest mass has the largest gravitational pull, that happens to be our star. If a larger star would fly past our solar system, or even a star with the same mass but moving closer to us, the Earth would be flung out of orbit and our planet would become roaming. We would no longer be orbiting a big mass like the sun. \n\nWe would also feel the Earth accelerating with the force of this new star.\n\n> But, the sun is the most convenient place to choose since it's the largest mass and therefore the ultimate driver of gravity and other forces for everything else in the solar system. So choosing the earth or anything else is indeed odd and doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it isn't *wrong*.\n\nIndeed it is not wrong, however the thought is not complete, and can't be taken seriously as a result. We know the Earth is moving, and if we observe where its moving then we get an oval around the sun. Same thing with the sun, only on a much much bigger scale around the Milky Way.

I just thought it'd be funny to prove almost everyone wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>you're not proving anyone wrong though</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the \"simple\" explanation is, if you're in a car, you know from being outside that cars move, but observe that from inside the car, it is actually the world zooming past you; otherwise the movement would push you against the seat the same way someone outside getting hit with the car would, but instead you don't move or even feel the pressure to slide back</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Humans dont feel movement. The thing we're able to feel is acceleration, that's why we feel different when the car is accelerating (+-) compared to when the speed is constant. It's the same thing with our inner ear being able to hear which way is down because of gravity. When we are in a moving car, we are moving at almost the same rate as the car, i.e. the relative speed between us and the car would be around 0.</p>\n<p>The car brought us up to that speed, and if it were to abruptly stop we would find ourselves being flung forward because we would not have slowed down, only the car.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it is actually the world zooming past you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>this is philosophy, not scientific.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even spills and dust and feathers fall straight down inside, proving that it is the world around you moving and the car remains stationary</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>short answer: no.</p>\n<p>go ahead, get inside the car with your favourite drink, feel yourself being accelerated. When you reach a constant speed, spill your favourite drink between the front seats and see it fly back to the back seats. When the liquid is in the cup it has potential energy, when you pour it out it has kinetic energy. but only at the spot you poured it out on. It itself has not been affected by the cars movement. It moves in the direction of gravity, it's not trying to behave like a pet and obey your orders of it having to be spilled out underneath the cup.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even spills and dust and feathers fall straight down inside, proving that it is the world around you moving and the car remains stationary</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we're going to play the gender game like you do later on in your text, then sure. My feeble female brain cannot understand what you're trying to prove here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Majority seems to rule and you accept that this is just an illusion, but it's actually not. It's simply two different perspectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Majority? Maybe there is something to it then if it's the majority rule. Just as theres something to the \"bluepill\" if everyone you met told you the same exact things. X.</p>\n<p>The reason we find cars to be moving when we're walking on the pavement outside is because we are moving at a slower speed than them. The the same thing when we find other cars being stationary on the road when in reality they're just moving at a slower rate than our vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any point you select to compare movement against will always be in the center, fixed and stationary, because it's literally your point of comparison.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How about I tell you that nothing is fixed and stationary. Galaxies roam, love. We perceive it as such because we are moving at the same speed the object is. And we're moving at the same speed the earth is. My IKEA wardrobe seems to be stationary but it is moving the same speed as the Earth. It doesnt matter what perspective we see it from. If my wardrobe was the centre, how come the Milky Way isn't orbiting around it?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, in programming when rendering 3D worlds you do not have any \"camera\" to move around, as it's always on screen; instead you move the world itself. The same applies to the earth and the sun. This is why we don't feel the earth moving or get thrown off of it, because from our own point of reference it's not moving at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the contrary, when I am using CAD I am moving the camera around the object(s). They're stationary on a plane. If I moved them, then the measurement plane would have to move as well, using a lot more of the computer's power which is unessecary.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if you stand on the sun, earth is moving around it and rotating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First off, I was standing on the sun I would be dead, even if I stood on a coldspot.</p>\n<p>The reason I would perceive it as such is because it <em>is</em>. If I stood at the centre of the Milky Way, I would perceive the sun to be rotating around that point, because it <em>is</em>. The largest mass has the largest gravitational pull, that happens to be our star. If a larger star would fly past our solar system, or even a star with the same mass but moving closer to us, the Earth would be flung out of orbit and our planet would become roaming. We would no longer be orbiting a big mass like the sun.</p>\n<p>We would also feel the Earth accelerating with the force of this new star.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But, the sun is the most convenient place to choose since it's the largest mass and therefore the ultimate driver of gravity and other forces for everything else in the solar system. So choosing the earth or anything else is indeed odd and doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it isn't <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed it is not wrong, however the thought is not complete, and can't be taken seriously as a result. We know the Earth is moving, and if we observe where its moving then we get an oval around the sun. Same thing with the sun, only on a much much bigger scale around the Milky Way. It also orbits along with Jupiter as the planet is only 1 000 times smaller than the sun. As such it doesnt orbit the sun, it orbits a point between the sun and Jupiter called the barycentre. This affects both Jupiter and the sun. interesting, right!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also the fact that earth, on top of the solar system, on top of the milky way \"moves\" very fast yet everything within our solar system does not fly past us, but remains completely in place as if it were stationary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>because we are moving, and they are moving. When we are driving, we see cars moving at different paces outside. Sometimes even zooming past. everything is moving and cannot accelerate without an outside force. The reason we dont see everything that is zooming past in is <em>because</em> our vision is not that good, our vision gets blocked by our atmosphere. There are different factors, like light pollution and light itself that hinders us from seeing all the coolness of space.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1611999293, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1611999662, "fullname": "t3_pc0k", "guild_id": "35", "herald_guild": null, "id": "pc0k", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 5, "parent_comment_id": ["pb35"], "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/75so/the-sun-and-the-universe-really/pc0k", "post_id": "75so", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["pc0k"], "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/75so/the-sun-and-the-universe-really/pdbm", "post": {"author_name": "CrystalVulpine", "award_count": 0, "body": "And earth also still does revolve around the sun and spins and moves at the same time.
