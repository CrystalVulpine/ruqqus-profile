I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined.

This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually <em>want</em> to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies. They'd be happier and have more fun that way too.</p>\n", "comment_count": 71, "created_utc": 1612232184, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 10, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_79k5", "guild_id": "35", "guild_name": "UnpopularOpinion", "herald_guild": null, "id": "79k5", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/79k5/females-are-way-smarter-than-males", "score": 2, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Females are way smarter than males and should be pushed to succeed instead of coddled and allowed to be lazy", "upvotes": 12, "url": ""}, "post_id": "79k5", "score": 0, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way.

If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined.

Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides.

Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness.

In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas. All across the board it's been shown that girls are substantially better learners than boys, and have sharper and more active minds. Girls also have a *significant* advantage in the arts, languages, music, humanities, even just simple functions like memory and emotion. While still having a slight advantage even in \"male\" subjects like STEM. Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better. Males commit suicide 3.5x more despite supposedly having less depression (I suspect it's actually because depression is biologically hardwired into males so is rarely taken seriously for them, in fact \"whining\" about it is usually punished).\r\n\r\nIt's not just stereotypes and observational evidence though. Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.</p>\n<p>So why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it <em>extremely</em> well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually <em>want</em> to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies.

So are the least. The current consensus is that the average intelligence for both sexes is the same, but males are more variable than females.\r\n\r\nI call that bull. I think the entire intelligence curve for females is simply shifted to the right of males. In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas. All across the board it's been shown that girls are substantially better learners than boys, and have sharper and more active minds. Girls also have a *significant* advantage in the arts, languages, music, humanities, even just simple functions like memory and emotion.

Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better. Males commit suicide 3.5x more despite supposedly having less depression (I suspect it's actually because depression is biologically hardwired into males so is rarely taken seriously for them, in fact \"whining\" about it is usually punished).\r\n\r\nIt's not just stereotypes and observational evidence though. Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically.

Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar?

My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it <em>extremely</em> well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually <em>want</em> to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies. They'd be happier and have more fun that way too.</p>\n", "comment_count": 71, "created_utc": 1612232184, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 10, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_79k5", "guild_id": "35", "guild_name": "UnpopularOpinion", "herald_guild": null, "id": "79k5", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+UnpopularOpinion/post/79k5/females-are-way-smarter-than-males", "score": 2, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Females are way smarter than males and should be pushed to succeed instead of coddled and allowed to be lazy", "upvotes": 12, "url": ""}, "post_id": "79k5", "score": 2, "upvotes": 3, "voted": 0}

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults!

Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

In every single hard class at high school and university level, there are far more boys but the handful of girls are always at the top of the class, easily solving problems that stump the hell out of the boys. It's the same at any non-blue-collar workplace, there are more male employees overall but the female minority does a better job, is more productive, and comes up with more ideas. All across the board it's been shown that girls are substantially better learners than boys, and have sharper and more active minds. Girls also have a <em>significant</em> advantage in the arts, languages, music, humanities, even just simple functions like memory and emotion.

Pretty much anything involving designing or creating, even simple outside the box thinking, females are naturally going to be way better. Males commit suicide 3.5x more despite supposedly having less depression (I suspect it's actually because depression is biologically hardwired into males so is rarely taken seriously for them, in fact \"whining\" about it is usually punished).</p>\n<p>It's not just stereotypes and observational evidence though. Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.</p>\n<p>So why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it <em>extremely</em> well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually <em>want</em> to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential. I think there needs to be a serious shift in raising girls to become productive persons rather than docile crybabies.

Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society.

Brain scans back this up too. Female brains are typically a bit smaller, but so was Einstein's. Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness. And even then, only in the real physical world; females are still usually superior at crafting, designing, and drawing shapes and 3d perspectives. This also makes biological sense. Think back to ancient times, when male was the more \"disposable\" sex that was constantly sent into risky and brutal situations, fighting, mating, and laboring, while the females engaged more in homemaking, childrearing, and organizing society. You don't need much of a brain to do the former, and with so many resources devoted to it, males lose a lot of other capabilities. Men are pretty much smarter as children than they are as adults! Why do you think Homer Simpson is so familiar? This explains some other things too, like why men die younger and feel pain worse despite having to endure more painful situations.\r\n\r\nSo why are some men still more successful and have higher IQs? My theory is societal expectations. From the moment they enter school, boys MUST succeed, do what they're told, and do it *extremely* well or there will be consequences. Girls are usually given a lot more slack. Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing. But obviously the people who actually *want* to pursue things instead of being lazy are the minority of the population. If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined. She will usually be multi-talented, easy to work with, have a lot of ideas, well-rounded and brilliant. Top IQs reflect this, in which they are almost all males but the #1 spot goes to a female. If most females would put down the makeup and snapchat and become interested in something actually productive like the males are made to do, I think their intelligence would improve quite drastically. But we instead encourage that hyper \"girly\" behavior which doesn't accomplish anything except make it even harder for the sexes to understand each other than it already would be. Boys are far too neglected and girls are way too coddled. It doesn't make any sense to have lower expectations for the ones with higher potential.

Female brains have denser neurons that more than make up for it, and their hippocampus and cortices are all larger and wired much more efficiently than in males, which correlates to higher cognitive ability. Not only that, but it's been shown that males pretty much exclusively use the left side of their brain (logical, stoic, rational, logical, and blunt) while females are capable of using both sides. This is why men are usually so uncreative, unemotional (except for anger), unartistic, unsympathetic, and lack even the most basic intuition and feeling. Pretty much the only thing males excel at in the mental realm is spatial awareness.

Boys are expected to have careers and become independent, whereas girls are allowed to leech off of them their whole lives, and allowed to run to someone else crying for help with every tiny thing that doesn't go their way. So what happens is that only the ambitious girls end up cultivating their skills. And when they do, the results are amazing.

If you pick out 10 geniuses, chances are 9 of them will be boys but the one girl will be smarter than half of them combined.
