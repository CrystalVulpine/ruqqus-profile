Being weird online: Yeah I can get behind this. I think a lot of it stems from the fact that people read comments in their heads with added intent that just cannot be gleaned from most text posts. If there is any hint of someone else being irate or snarky in their text we hear that in our heads, whether that was their intent or not. I try not to be so reactionary to text posts, but even I fail most of the time. The solution may be to read a comment a few times and try to have a better understanding, or just to try and hear it in our heads as not being combatitive.\n\n2. Commenting on politics: This is malarkey. Yeah Jesus and Paul didn't speak much about politics because their cause was not political but spiritual. That doesn't mean that we as christians shouldn't speak against a political party that is doing evil and speak up for one that is doing good. I've long held that lack of political involvement has lead us to where we are now in America, in a position where the godless run academia, big tech, the media and the government. Stop backing down from politics, but learn to control being hot-headed about it, which can lead to going off the rails and give christians a bad name.\n\n3. Handling conflict poorly: I would venture to say that many christians have no idea how to handle conflict in a productive manner. We either avoid it altogether or try to run someone over because we can't figure out any other argument except, \"The bible is right\" and \"Jesus is lord\". Though these are truthful the unsaved have no concept of why they should ascribe to these same things.\n\n4. Ranking sin selectively: Yes the church needs to get this under control, but the modern church also needs a refresher on what actual sin is, since many have no idea. Divorce is rampant and widely accepted in the Western church while even looking at a woman and thinking she looks nice is considered sin. Likely this will never be adjusted on a wide scale.\n\n5. Judging outsiders: We are not called to judge the unsaved but to wisely cast judgement on those who call themselves part of the body. However this doesn't mean that we cannot make judgements on the behavior of \"outsiders\" and determine that they are doing good or ill and then make judgements based on that. Do you want to associate with that person? Do you trust that person? You cannot judge the status of their salvation but you most certainly can, and should, judge the content of their character.\n\nOverall an interesting read, but it seems a little whiney to me.", "body_html": "<p>TLDR and my commentary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Being weird online: Yeah I can get behind this.
