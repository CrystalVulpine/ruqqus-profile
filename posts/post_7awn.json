They were investing for better future, cut back on unnecessary luxuries, rejected most of their women's spending proposals because 99% of them were usually garbage and useless.  This hurt a lot of rich investors.  The elites who profited off all those wars were looking for ways to increase the average spending by the masses so they could control the market and thus the cash flow.  They saw the individualistic men acting as barriers preventing their women and children entering into the mindless consumerism \"utopia\" the rich had laid down.  So they schemed and funded the feminism movement for decades.  Basically vilified every living male in the eyes of a woman.  Those retards took the bait.  Not just any ordinary 'taking' of the bait, they took the bait so hard like their entire life and their gender were depending on it.  They left the wholesome conservative family lifestyle to voluntarily becoming a wage slave to some corporation in the act of \"liberation\" of female gender.  That is the ultimate irony of all this.  The elites got what they wanted.  Average spending increased, the amount of taxation increased, the amount of debt increased.  People who spoke against it were character assassinated.  Back in the silent generation, a single man could provide for the whole family (includes half a dozen kids).  Now even if both parents work, there is no guarantee that kid is going to be useful to this society.  At best, it will be another wage slave.","body_html":"<p>The problem to the system was that men weren't spending enough.  They were investing for better future, cut back on unnecessary luxuries, rejected most of their women's spending proposals because 99% of them were usually garbage and useless.  This hurt a lot of rich investors.  The elites who profited off all those wars were looking for ways to increase the average spending by the masses so they could control the market and thus the cash flow.  They saw the individualistic men acting as barriers preventing their women and children entering into the mindless consumerism \"utopia\" the rich had laid down.  So they schemed and funded the feminism movement for decades.  Basically vilified every living male in the eyes of a woman.  Those retards took the bait.  Not just any ordinary 'taking' of the bait, they took the bait so hard like their entire life and their gender were depending on it.  They left the wholesome conservative family lifestyle to voluntarily becoming a wage slave to some corporation in the act of \"liberation\" of female gender.  That is the ultimate irony of all this.  The elites got what they wanted.  Average spending increased, the amount of taxation increased, the amount of debt increased.  People who spoke against it were character assassinated.  Back in the silent generation, a single man could provide for the whole family (includes half a dozen kids).  Now even if both parents work, there is no guarantee that kid is going to be useful to this society.  At best, it will be another wage slave.</p>\n","created_utc":1612359703,"downvotes":4,"edited_utc":1612359758,"fullname":"t3_ppx5","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#7B9AE4","created_utc":1582833064,"description":"Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?

I see some women post now and again, \"wait, why did women want to go to college and enter the workforce when a man can just do that for them, again?\" So, some women notice the newly created problems.</p>\n<p>Conditions need to be created or strengthened to support these kinds of norms, like making it a \"reponsible\" choice for women to opt not to go to college, and for high school curriculums preparing women for a different life (see also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_work\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"women's work\"</a>). Men are put in a position of needing to perhaps be even more aggressive and competitive in response to the pressures applied by attempting to reduce their productive ability as well as diluting the value of average effort by raising the incomes of women.</p>\n<p>There's also the \"drop out\" of \"normal\" society approach which works a bit. We're here on Ruqqus, rather than making a fuss on R*ddit, we just come here, and similarly there are men and women who want to live traditional lives that just find each other and make the best of things under the circumstances.</p>\n","created_utc":1612375949,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_pqoe","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#7B9AE4","created_utc":1582833064,"description":"Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?
