Especially when it comes to America and the American economy/federal reserve/history of centralized banking. It would be alarming if I wasn't so sure it is 90% bots and people who are not old enough to vote.</p>\n<p>I guess my point is that reading posts and comments on Reddit always made me feel a little uncomfortable, but I could never quite put my finger on why and after taking an extended absence I think I have figured it out.... being there made me uncomfortable because of the unbridled ignorance on full display there.</p>\n", "comment_count": 23, "created_utc": 1612717187, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_7f5t", "guild_id": "1", "guild_name": "general", "herald_guild": null, "id": "7f5t", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+general/post/7f5t/lol-reddit", "score": 22, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Lol @reddit.", "upvotes": 23, "url": ""}, "post_id": "7f5t", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
