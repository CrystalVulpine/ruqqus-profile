Marcion insisted on a literal interpretation of the old testament and believed that the creator was an evil tyrant separate from the father of Christ. He and his followers were vegans, did not procreate, and had all kinds of ridiculous rules and teachings (ironic given their gripe about the old testament). Marcion also said Paul was the only apostle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the church became reactionary and instead of being honest wrote these epistles for Paul to disprove Marcion. The entirety of the pastorals reads like a summary of Marcionism:\r\n\r\n* False teachers\r\n\r\n* False teachers are forbidding eating certain foods and marriage (Marcionite veganism and anti-procreation) (1 Timothy 4:3)\r\n\r\n* Seeking marriage is commanded and procreation and Roman family structure is the most central part of life. In fact, bearing children is even set as a requirement for salvation (1 Timothy 2:15).\r\n\r\n* Women must be silent and submissive housewives and mothers (lots of women were high up in Marcion's assembly)\r\n\r\n* The law is portrayed in a very positive light and good works are essential (Marcion did not think highly of the OT law)\r\n\r\n* Uses the \"shipwreck\" analogy (Marcion was a ship trader).\r\n\r\n* Complains about \"jewish myths\" constantly (Strange as it sounds, Marcion was accused of being a Judaizer for his interpretation of the OT).\r\n\r\n* The pastorals seem to teach the idea that Jesus was merely a man mediating for the OT God (to contrast with Marcion's belief that the OT God was separate from Christ's) (1 Timothy 2:5)\r\n\r\nWe know that Marcion was in error about a great many things. However it seems that the early church was more concerned with defeating their enemies than being honest. Instead, they wrote the pastoral epistles in the name of Marcion's favorite apostle, which simply proclaim everything the opposite of Marcion. This reactionary nature does not accurately represent Paul, so any attempt to claim it was one of his students writing for him does not stand. While Paul clearly disagreed with Marcion in many ways, in any case where Paul *does* agree with Marcion the pastorals disagree with him in order to disagree with Marcion:\r\n\r\n* Real Paul never frowned upon marriage as did Marcion, but commended the unmarried as having done better, opposite of the pastoral theology (1 Corinthians 7)\r\n\r\n* Real Paul believed the OT law to be a stumbling block which leads to sin. It was fulfilled and freedom in Christ is emphasized.\r\n\r\n* Real Paul was not hesitant to hold women high regard or employ them in high positions (Romans 16)\r\n\r\n* Real Paul concerned himself not with the things of this world, but the next, assuring that this one is only a vapor in time and does not matter. \"Paul\" of the pastorals however was primarily concerned with conforming to Greco-Roman social norms, marriage & procreation, organized church structure, and the affairs of this life.\r\n\r\nI would not advise putting much trust in the pastoral epistles.
