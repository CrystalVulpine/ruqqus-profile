Marcion also said Paul was the only apostle.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the church became reactionary and instead of being honest wrote these epistles for Paul to disprove Marcion. The entirety of the pastorals reads like a summary of Marcionism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>False teachers are forbidding eating certain foods and marriage (Marcionite veganism and anti-procreation) (1 Timothy 4:3) \"[false teachers] forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods which God created for use with thankfulness by the faithful and knowing of the truth\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seeking marriage is commanded and procreation and Roman family structure is the most central part of life, and church officials must both be husbands and have well-liked children (1 Timothy 3:4-5, Titus 1:5-6). In fact, bearing children is even set as a requirement for salvation (1 Timothy 2:15) \"But [women] will be saved by the bearing of children...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Women must be silent and submissive housewives and mothers (lots of women were high up in Marcion's assembly) (1 Timothy 2:11-2:14, 1 Timothy 5:14 and several other passages)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The law is portrayed in a very positive light and good works are essential (Marcion did not think highly of the OT law)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uses the \"shipwreck\" analogy (and Marcion was a ship trader) (1 Timothy 1:19).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complains about jewish myths constantly (Strange as it sounds, Marcion was called a Judaizer by the church fathers for his interpretation of the OT).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pastorals seem to teach the idea that Jesus was merely a man mediating for the OT God (to contrast with Marcion's belief that the OT God was separate from Christ's) (1 Timothy 2:5) \"For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the MAN Anointed Jesus\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know that Marcion was in error about a great many things. However it seems that the early church was more concerned with defeating their enemies than being honest. Instead, they wrote the pastoral epistles in the name of Marcion's favorite apostle, which simply proclaim everything the opposite of Marcion. This reactionary nature does not accurately represent Paul, so any attempt to claim it was one of his students writing for him does not stand. While Paul clearly disagreed with Marcion in many ways, in any case where Paul <em>does</em> agree with Marcion the pastorals disagree with him in order to disagree with Marcion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul never frowned upon marriage as did Marcion, but commended the unmarried as having done better, opposite of the pastoral theology (1 Corinthians 7)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul believed the OT law to be a stumbling block which leads to sin. It was fulfilled and freedom in Christ is emphasized (Romans 7).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul was not hesitant to hold women high regard or employ them in high positions (Romans 16)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real Paul concerned himself not with the things of this world, but the next, assuring that this one is only a vapor in time and does not matter. \"Paul\" of the pastorals however was primarily concerned with conforming to Greco-Roman social norms, marriage &amp; procreation, organized church structure, and the affairs of this life. Some of it appears to be developing Catholicism.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would not advise putting much trust in the pastoral epistles. They were not from a faithful follower but some reactionary church father. They teach several other problematic commands, such as abandoning widows (1 Timothy 5) and possibly even condoning slavery (1 Timothy 6:1-2, but the language is unclear). \"Peter's\" epistles and Jude and James (which teaches a works salvation btw) are probably counterfeits as well. Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, and most of the non-Pauline epistles all have a good chance of not being authentic, and possibly even Revelation. Of course we could also just follow Jesus instead of men and this wouldn't be much of a problem in the first place.</p>\n","comment_count":4,"created_utc":1613358800,"domain":"text post","downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_7my5","guild_id":"1by","guild_name":"Bible","herald_guild":null,"id":"7my5","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Bible/post/7my5/1-2-timothy-and-titus-why","score":1,"thumb_url":null,"title":"1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus, why they were forged and teach false doctrines","upvotes":2,"url":""},"post_id":"7my5","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
