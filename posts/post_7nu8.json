And don't lie to me, being \"talented\" at anything outside of sports is seen as a feminine trait and always has been, everyone knows that. It's not without reason. Male simply is not supposed to have a rich, sophisticated inner world. We're designed to be warriors, workers, and sperm donors. That doesn't require much thought or even a \"personal life\" hardly at all. And yes it's natural talent, because it's due to observed brain differences; male and female brains are wired and built fundamentally differently, male for physio-spatial functions and female more well rounded and geared toward logic and creativity. Unfortunately for males, the second function is both the enjoyable one and the one that's not obsolete in modern life.
