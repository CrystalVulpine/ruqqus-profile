But according to ageing expert Prof David Gems at University College London, mortality in men soars once puberty hits.

But the good news is that not all of our ageing is predetermined. The Russian gap between the sexes, for instance, is thought to be due to the culture of heavy drinking and smoking.

While women have a biological advantage, historically certain living conditions and social customs tended to negate this benefit. For example, iron deficiency anemia due to female blood loss contributed in the past to excess female mortality. Social differences between men and women and the challenges of motherhood have further compromised women\u2019s biological advantage.\n\nFemale hormones, particularly estrogen, and the resiliency of the female body to accommodate pregnancy and breast-feeding are also thought to promote longevity. Estrogens have beneficial effects on lipids in the blood and seem to protect a woman from premature heart disease.\n\nMale behaviors tend to be riskier, and more men are exposed to hazards in the workplace. Men experience more motor vehicle accidents and have higher rates of alcoholism and smoking. In addition, males tend to drive more aggressively than females, and men on average smoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol than women. These excess risks in men tend to increase the likelihood of heart disease and malignancy.\n\nThe ways the genders relate to their bodies is another potential factor explaining male and female longevity differences. Women tend to be more health conscious and attend to their bodies, seeking preventive health care and practicing healthier lifestyles compared to men. Men relate to their bodies with strength and power and expose them to risks from early ages.\n\nAnother way to approach the longevity differential between women and men is to look at the causes of death across the life span. Graphs of mortality ratios by gender show excess male mortality by violence that peaks at 4:1 around age 30. Gender-specific mortality rates for the top 10 causes of death shows excess male-to-female ratio for all conditions except diabetes mellitus, for which the risk is identical. Whether this gender gap relates to biological differences or lifestyle choices such as cigarette smoking is a matter of debate.

With women, if one of the genes on the X chromosome becomes faulty, they have a healthy \u2018backup\u2019 copy. Men, on the other hand, have to make do with any faulty genes on their single X chromosome, which can put them at a greater risk of disease.\n\nFrom the moment they are a ball of cells, males are more vulnerable than females, with male babies at a 20 per cent greater risk of dying in the womb. But according to ageing expert Prof David Gems at University College London, mortality in men soars once puberty hits. Some of this is due to men\u2019s more risky behaviour, but studies suggest that long-term problems are caused by the physical changes in the body created by the hormone testosterone.\n\nA 2012 study of records from pre-19th-Century Korea showed that eunuchs who were castrated as boys before the testosterone surge of puberty, lived 14 to 19 years longer than their contemporaries.\n\nWith the life expectancy differences so tied up with hormones and genetics, it seems unlikely that men will ever close the gap entirely. But the good news is that not all of our ageing is predetermined. The Russian gap between the sexes, for instance, is thought to be due to the culture of heavy drinking and smoking. As cultures can change, it\u2019s possible for both sexes to live healthier lives with the genetic hand they are dealt. Meanwhile, advances in our treatment of diseases should help us to close the gap even further.\"\n\n\"[...] the gender differential in life expectancy from birth is about 6.5 years greater for women in the U.S., 5.3 years in the UK, 12 years in Russia, and about 6 months in India. This societal diversity implies that social factors have an influence on male and female longevity. While women have a biological advantage, historically certain living conditions and social customs tended to negate this benefit. For example, iron deficiency anemia due to female blood loss contributed in the past to excess female mortality. Social differences between men and women and the challenges of motherhood have further compromised women\u2019s biological advantage.\n\nFemale hormones, particularly estrogen, and the resiliency of the female body to accommodate pregnancy and breast-feeding are also thought to promote longevity. Estrogens have beneficial effects on lipids in the blood and seem to protect a woman from premature heart disease.\n\nMale behaviors tend to be riskier, and more men are exposed to hazards in the workplace. Men experience more motor vehicle accidents and have higher rates of alcoholism and smoking. In addition, males tend to drive more aggressively than females, and men on average smoke more cigarettes and drink more alcohol than women. These excess risks in men tend to increase the likelihood of heart disease and malignancy.\n\nThe ways the genders relate to their bodies is another potential factor explaining male and female longevity differences. Women tend to be more health conscious and attend to their bodies, seeking preventive health care and practicing healthier lifestyles compared to men. Men relate to their bodies with strength and power and expose them to risks from early ages.\n\nAnother way to approach the longevity differential between women and men is to look at the causes of death across the life span. Graphs of mortality ratios by gender show excess male mortality by violence that peaks at 4:1 around age 30. Gender-specific mortality rates for the top 10 causes of death shows excess male-to-female ratio for all conditions except diabetes mellitus, for which the risk is identical. Whether this gender gap relates to biological differences or lifestyle choices such as cigarette smoking is a matter of debate. Perhaps diabetes in women somehow reduces the gender-specific advantage enjoyed by women for other diseases.\n\nNonetheless, the consequences of atherosclerosis clearly affect the longevity differential between men and women.
