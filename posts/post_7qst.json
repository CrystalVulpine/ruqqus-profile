The questions you post and your comments are the words of one who knows God is real but hates Him, so time is spent trying to convince others to hate Him as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I never denied God was real nor do I detest him. What I detest is people doing evil in God's name. People using \"God\" as an excuse to demand special treatment for themselves while mistreating others. Do you know who the Pharisees and Sadducees were?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Loaded with tons of \"gotcha\" catch phrases and little bits of scripture, its cute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what <em>you</em> do with your \"proof texts\" to support your crazy doctrines such as women should be nothing but pieces of meat at mens' disposal. I can't speak for you but in my experience people saying those things do that, quote little bits from Paul's letters (most of which aren't even really his) and a few other pieces and twist it any way they want to. And rarely ever giving the gospels, the literal words of Jesus, any attention.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>without the imbuing of the Holy spirit you will never grasp an understanding of scripture, and you should be summarily ignored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In contrast, I understand it much better than I used to, when I was like you, when I fell for all these lies of TV preachers and political theology. The Holy Spirit taught me far more clearly. Things are starting to make sense now.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1615059771, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_sia7", "guild_id": "26u", "herald_guild": null, "id": "sia7", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 4, "parent_comment_id": ["shsi"], "permalink": "/+GodFamilyAndCountry/post/7qst/how-porn-is-destroying-you-and/sia7", "post_id": "7qst", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["sia7"], "permalink": "/+GodFamilyAndCountry/post/7qst/how-porn-is-destroying-you-and/sj3d", "post": {"author_name": "IAmQuietFire", "award_count": 0, "body": "Food for thought.", "body_html": "<p>Food for thought.</p>\n", "comment_count": 6, "created_utc": 1613686083, "domain": "youtube.com", "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_7qst", "guild_id": "26u", "guild_name": "GodFamilyAndCountry", "herald_guild": null, "id": "7qst", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "Our young men are suffering from a manufactured addiction to internet pornography, the results of which are invariably swept under the rug.
