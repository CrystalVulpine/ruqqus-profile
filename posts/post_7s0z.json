As to which one, according to the church fathers they had been mistaken about their prior statements of Hebrew Matthew having no genealogy, and that it actually did contain one.

Personally I think it's fake, as it's only referenced at the beginning of Matthew and Luke, the latter clearly being a later addition to the original Luke. Nowhere else do any of the writers show any indication of knowing about a virgin birth, including in the rest of Matthew and Luke. Additionally, some of the oldest manuscripts of Matthew read \"Joseph begat Jesus\" and many current references to Joseph are \"Jesus's father\" in the oldest manuscripts. The genealogy in Matthew makes no sense if Mary conceived as a virgin, as it shows Joseph's line of descent, not Mary's, and the whole point is to show how Jesus came from the Davidic line. I have a theory however about why this story was added: the faithless church fathers, instead of believing because it is self-evident, either newly interpreted Isaiah 7:14 as messianic, or it was actually put there by Matthew, but the church fathers, due to a mistranslation in the LXX, thought it meant virgin when it was actually young woman (the same word is used for both). Either way, they lacked faith and only cared about creating a religious system to control people, and authored this story to \"prove\" it right. Ironically, the original Hebrew prophecy is only correct if Joseph is Jesus's (biological) father. It's also possible that they wanted to introduce elements of pagan legends, though harmless ones in this case (unless you take it to the extreme of worshiping Mary).</p>\n","comment_count":32,"created_utc":1613781766,"domain":"text post","downvotes":3,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_7s0z","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"7s0z","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/7s0z/what-do-you-think-of-the","score":0,"thumb_url":null,"title":"What do you think of the virgin birth story?","upvotes":3,"url":""},"post_id":"7s0z","score":0,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
