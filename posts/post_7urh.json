This would make sense too, because for some reason 1 Corinthians in particular is FULL of pastoral interpolations in attempt to make Paul agree with the fake epistles 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus. Looking at 6:9-10, the parallels between it and 1 Timothy 1:9-11 are obvious, even sharing a few words that are attested *nowhere else in Greek writings*. It appears the writer made them up out of obsession with particular topics, indicating that the writer of 1 Cor 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy are likely the same. And we can be quite certain that the author of the original 1 Corinthians (Paul) is not the person who wrote 1 Timothy.

This explanation makes the most sense to me, because it *does* seem like verses 9-10 are really trying to push the sinless perfection narrative (it's actually difficult to not translate it as \"The unrighteous ones of God will not inherit the kingdom\"), even though Paul goes on to say the exact opposite a few verses later, and also did so earlier in the same letter (see 3:15), not to mention everything in his other letters. Another contradiction is that in the very same passage, Paul, or more likely \"Paul\" commands the Corinthians to judge those in the church, probably implying that they should kill the person in question...when Paul said literally the *exact opposite* earlier on in the letter (4:3-5), as he usually does. However, while there is an off-section in this part of the text, it is only 6:3-6. The rest of it the redactor has bridged quite well to the original text, as I cannot tell exactly where it begins and ends as I usually can, just the parts which contradict real Paul. This fact is evidence that they may be wrongly translated and interpreted instead of interpolated, but I feel like that's a bit of a stretch from the way they're worded.

Did you guys know that there are numerous other people who came both before and after Jesus, claiming to be the messiah? Jesus himself referenced them, Gamliel referenced them, and a quick google search will yield a list of those who have come after him, though the list of those before seems harder to find, likely lost in time.\r\n\r\nWhat distinction can be made between Jesus and these other tens, maybe hundreds of people who claimed to be the Jewish messiah? That all of the others came to nothing; almost as though God not only lifted up Jesus, but also put down all other false messiahs, and brought them to nought, as described by Gamaliel in Acts 5:33:\r\n\r\n>When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. \r\n\r\n>And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. \r\n\r\n>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found to fight against God.”\r\n\r\nHere some 2000 years later, and Jesus' prophecy that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his church still stands true, however weak the body may be after millennia of persecution and tribulation, in Matthew 16:18:\r\n\r\n>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, **and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.**\r\n\r\nSo, how is it that all other religions have had such weak ripples, Jewish messiahs specifically have had almost no success, as though they only threw a pebble into a pond, but Jesus has seemingly thrown a mountain into a sea? How could this be? \r\n\r\nCan this be attributed to our \"reptile\" overlords, as many assert? That religion is a tool to control the population? Did Satan come up with the idea of moral perfection, the pursuit of righteousness, and faith in God, and eternal life, all in an effort to control those very people that he already had control of as he saw fit?\r\n\r\n*Can* these concepts be made up? How often do you speak with trouble makers, ungodly folk, and they try to subvert you into behaving perfectly, righteously, and virtuously? Even most \"pastors\" I speak to do not encourage such behavior. Why? How can the bible be so \"popular\" but nobody actually takes it seriously? \r\n\r\nJesus asked (Luke 6:46), why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?\r\n\r\nYou might want to think long and hard about whether you really love God or not.  Not just if you want to love him, but if you really love him. If you really recognize him as who he claims to be, the creator of heaven and earth. Imagine claiming to recognize someone as the creator of heaven and earth, but still thinking you know better than him. \"I know Jesus said not to do that but it's okay, he will forgive me.\"  MY FRIEND, have you not received forgiveness already?? Why then should he have to do it again? How long will you grieve his heart?

Not as in, do you not wear your seatbelt, but as in, are you fornicating? Are you a drunkard? Are you covetous, your life consisting of material possessions? Do you steal? Do you scoff?

Another contradiction is that in the very same passage, Paul, or more likely \"Paul\" commands the Corinthians to judge those in the church, probably implying that they should kill the person in question...when Paul said literally the *exact opposite* earlier on in the letter (4:3-5), as he usually does. However, while there is an off-section in this part of the text, it is only 6:3-6. The rest of it the redactor has bridged quite well to the original text, as I cannot tell exactly where it begins and ends as I usually can, just the parts which contradict real Paul.

Did you guys know that there are numerous other people who came both before and after Jesus, claiming to be the messiah? Jesus himself referenced them, Gamliel referenced them, and a quick google search will yield a list of those who have come after him, though the list of those before seems harder to find, likely lost in time.\r\n\r\nWhat distinction can be made between Jesus and these other tens, maybe hundreds of people who claimed to be the Jewish messiah? That all of the others came to nothing; almost as though God not only lifted up Jesus, but also put down all other false messiahs, and brought them to nought, as described by Gamaliel in Acts 5:33:\r\n\r\n>When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. \r\n\r\n>And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.

After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. \r\n\r\n>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found to fight against God.”\r\n\r\nHere some 2000 years later, and Jesus' prophecy that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his church still stands true, however weak the body may be after millennia of persecution and tribulation, in Matthew 16:18:\r\n\r\n>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, **and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.**\r\n\r\nSo, how is it that all other religions have had such weak ripples, Jewish messiahs specifically have had almost no success, as though they only threw a pebble into a pond, but Jesus has seemingly thrown a mountain into a sea? How could this be? \r\n\r\nCan this be attributed to our \"reptile\" overlords, as many assert? That religion is a tool to control the population?

How often do you speak with trouble makers, ungodly folk, and they try to subvert you into behaving perfectly, righteously, and virtuously? Even most \"pastors\" I speak to do not encourage such behavior. Why? How can the bible be so \"popular\" but nobody actually takes it seriously? \r\n\r\nJesus asked (Luke 6:46), why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?\r\n\r\nYou might want to think long and hard about whether you really love God or not.  Not just if you want to love him, but if you really love him. If you really recognize him as who he claims to be, the creator of heaven and earth. Imagine claiming to recognize someone as the creator of heaven and earth, but still thinking you know better than him. \"I know Jesus said not to do that but it's okay, he will forgive me.\"  MY FRIEND, have you not received forgiveness already??

How can the bible be so \"popular\" but nobody actually takes it seriously? \r\n\r\nJesus asked (Luke 6:46), why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?\r\n\r\nYou might want to think long and hard about whether you really love God or not.  Not just if you want to love him, but if you really love him. If you really recognize him as who he claims to be, the creator of heaven and earth. Imagine claiming to recognize someone as the creator of heaven and earth, but still thinking you know better than him. \"I know Jesus said not to do that but it's okay, he will forgive me.\"  MY FRIEND, have you not received forgiveness already?? Why then should he have to do it again? How long will you grieve his heart? How long will **we** grieve his heart?\r\n\r\nMatthew 7:21\r\n\r\n>“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, **‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’**\r\n\r\nDo you practice lawlessness? Not as in, do you not wear your seatbelt, but as in, are you fornicating? Are you a drunkard? Are you covetous, your life consisting of material possessions? Do you steal? Do you scoff? Do you ignore the needy? Do you turn away the simple?\r\n\r\nKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? as attested by Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:9:\r\n\r\n>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.","body_html":"<p>John 14:15:</p>\n<p>Emphasis added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</strong> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me</strong>: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This lines up well with the definition of love as presented in 1 John 3:18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Love is not spoken, it is acted out. It is helping people, it is being patient with people, it is telling them the truth. The most basic example of loving someone by telling them the truth, is telling them if there is a booger hanging out of their nose rather than letting them go on their day looking foolish. But of course, most boogers are much harder to explain to people, boogers like greed and pride and our sinful nature.</p>\n<p>So if love includes telling people the truth, what is <em>the</em> truth? Because surely, just convincing someone to eat less, while it helps them, and would better their life, is that a more pressing issue than the fact that there is no hope outside of Christ? Why else do they see food as the solution to all of their problems, rather than the cause of many? What truth transcends truths such as \"you have a booger hanging out of your nose,\" and, \"you really should lose some weight?\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is this man Jesus claiming to himself be <em>the</em> truth, and not only <em>the</em> truth, but <em>the</em> way and <em>the</em> life; was Jesus puffed up like a marshmallow here? or was he telling the truth soberly?</p>\n<p>He also claims exclusive authority over any and all who desire to come to God, also telling us that if we have seen him, we have seen God, also in John 14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow, so at this point, this man is either the most delusional, prideful, and narcissistic person to have ever lived, or he is who he claims to be, surely this is not a slip of the tongue or a matter of semantics.  Did you guys know that there are numerous other people who came both before and after Jesus, claiming to be the messiah? Jesus himself referenced them, Gamliel referenced them, and a quick google search will yield a list of those who have come after him, though the list of those before seems harder to find, likely lost in time.</p>\n<p>What distinction can be made between Jesus and these other tens, maybe hundreds of people who claimed to be the Jewish messiah? That all of the others came to nothing; almost as though God not only lifted up Jesus, but also put down all other false messiahs, and brought them to nought, as described by Gamaliel in Acts 5:33:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them. Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found to fight against God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here some 2000 years later, and Jesus' prophecy that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his church still stands true, however weak the body may be after millennia of persecution and tribulation, in Matthew 16:18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, <strong>and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, how is it that all other religions have had such weak ripples, Jewish messiahs specifically have had almost no success, as though they only threw a pebble into a pond, but Jesus has seemingly thrown a mountain into a sea? How could this be?</p>\n<p>Can this be attributed to our \"reptile\" overlords, as many assert? That religion is a tool to control the population? Did Satan come up with the idea of moral perfection, the pursuit of righteousness, and faith in God, and eternal life, all in an effort to control those very people that he already had control of as he saw fit?</p>\n<p><em>Can</em> these concepts be made up?
