It also could come into play in dealing with interracial sex - which has attained dangerously mass scale - in the US. Pretty plain some force is going to be necessary to get that under control. Or if we're being honest: probably lots of force at this late emergency stage. Many Christian racialists are not prepared for that and might have objections to necessary measures due to religious qualms. This means they ultimately are not serious people if so. One set of values will contradict another set, thus making effective action impossible for them.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason in part that I don't view secularization as entirely negative - even if I'm not an atheist, say. The moralism of many Christians will have them conflicted and in crisis over ethical questions as their race is getting submerged.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1614683453, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1614686961, "fullname": "t3_s433", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/occidentalenclave/banner-2.png", "color": "#30409F", "created_utc": 1596949153, "description": "Dedicated to Western Civilization and Western culture\n\nClick Hot and then New to see the newest submissions.", "description_html": "<p>Dedicated to Western Civilization and Western culture</p>\n<p>Click Hot and then New to see the newest submissions.</p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_30s", "id": "30s", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "OccidentalEnclave", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+OccidentalEnclave", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/occidentalenclave/profile-1.png"}, "guild_id": "30s", "herald_guild": null, "id": "s433", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent": {"deleted_utc": 1615512095, "id": "s3z3", "level": 1, "parent": "t2_82e9", "post": "82e9"}, "parent_comment_id": ["s3z3"], "permalink": "/+OccidentalEnclave/post/82e9/do-racialism-and-christianity-conflict/s433", "post": {"ban_reason": "", "guild_name": "OccidentalEnclave", "id": "82e9", "is_banned": true, "is_deleted": false, "is_pinned": false, "permalink": "/+OccidentalEnclave/post/82e9/do-racialism-and-christianity-conflict", "title": "Do racialism and Christianity conflict?"}, "post_id": "82e9", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
