Unfortunately this is the result of primal instincts as the female body is more inherently valuable and scare for reproduction, and nature revolves around reproduction, so it will be pretty much impossible to stop. But historically the men have been jealous of this and oppressed them for revenge, sometimes to the point of literally treating them like property.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>more by believers in Christ than any other people since the beginning of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is correct. However you do not seem to be doing so.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The root of feminism has always been about breaking down the God created structure between man and woman and started with the serpent telling Eve she could be like God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The root of the initial waves of feminism was recognizing that envy isn't a valid reason to get revenge on someone, especially if they are not at fault for it (and no one chooses which chromosomes they're born with). Your argument assumes that every woman is identical to Eve, and even if that were true what this basically boils down to is \"yeah I did it too but <em>she started it</em>!\", hardly a valid excuse. If you want to read that much into a creation story which was undoubtedly exaggerated and expanded on over time before being written down, you should consider that it took a devil to deceive the woman but Adam just blindly ate the apple when Eve told him to. I can play this game too. That account has absolutely nothing to do with which chromosome is \"more evil\" than the other. The only thing it mentions is that men would mostly overpower women as one of the punishments, along arguably even worse consequences for the man.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your not even a christian</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I am, and I'm concerned that you don't recognize the good news.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1614990566, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_sg54", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1583035818, "description": "\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
