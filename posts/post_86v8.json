Reddit, inc as a privately owned platform is under no obligation to provide a platform to anyone for anything.  This goes for facebook, twitter, etc.  If it's owned by a private company you have no right to expect them to host whatever the hell you want to say.  Participation is a privilege, not a right and they can revoke that privilege at any time.  Actually if you read the TOS for most online services they come right out and say so.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrolls also often like to throw around quotes from Aaron Swartz(one of the founders of reddit) and how he supported absolute free speech.  This just isn't true.
