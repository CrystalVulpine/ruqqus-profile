What are you going to do? Die with it? Take it with you? Good luck with that.", "body_html": "<p>My grandpa was old school--or so we thought. That's how it came off. He never bought a car over $300--he looked like he got his clothes from the Salvation Army bin, for free---they had a small farm, and every year would slaughter a pig or 2 and have them cut at the local butcher shop for a small fee. My g'ma still wore her clothes from the 70's-80's when she died. All she ever wanted was to travel a little. I'm not talking 20K trips to Europe. She wanted to see Natural Bridge, VA, and maybe D.C once, and go visit family in SC. But no. He would never allow that. He didn't drive over 45 mph EVER (because it saved gas?), which almost killed me once when I was a little kid, btw, when I rode with them instead of my parents (the only time he left his hometown, much less the state, btw). That man could pinch a penny until it screamed for mercy and bled real blood.</p>\n<p>When he died, we found out my grand'pa was a real estate mogul. No, not a millionaire, but he wasn't poor. He had hundreds of thousand in the bank and owned 5 or 6 properties in \"town\" he rented out for income, all of them paid in full years before. He could have afforded to take my grand'ma to fucking SC on vacation to visit her cousin, or bought her a decent car to get around in, at least. Maybe some pretty dresses. But he didn't. Because he was a miserly cheapskate asshole.</p>\n<p>Marriage is a two way street. It's partnership. It's about trust, and being there for one another. It's a Union of two people who trust each other implicitly and work toward making one another Happy, fulfilled, and secure. It should be about being best friends for life. My grandma worked her ass off on the farm her whole life thinking they couldn't do any better on his salary as a carpenter and farmer. She slaughtered her own chickens and worked from sun up until past sunset taking care of her vegetables and caring for her chickens, cooking 3 meals a day for him---on a wood stove. She cooked on a wood stove because he was too fucking cheap to pay for gas. And she thought that was how things were. And she loved him anyway. And for 60+years of her life, her deadbeat, selfish, no good, cheap skate husband was hiding income from her that could have made her life easier and more fulfilling.</p>\n<p>Do not tell me about all your fucking selfish MGTOW and incel bullshit. If you marry someone, you should trust them. You should want what's best for them....you should want them to be happy and fulfilled. If you're hiding your money from them and acting like they're some kind of gold digger---first, Why the fuck are you with them? And two....You're a selfish piece of shit. I hope your money keeps you warm in your grave, you miserly, selfish asshole.</p>\n<p>She's better off without this selfish piece of garbage. Guarantee, if she had a high paying job and they married, he'd have lived off of her and hid his income anyway, making her think he had nothing while she supported HIM. And he would have actually justified this. He would have made it sound like he was doing HER a favor.....because that's how selfish people are.</p>\n<p>If you need a prenup----you either need to reevaluate your priorities---or reevaluate who you're marrying.</p>\n<p>What is money for but to make the people you love happier? What are you going to do? Die with it? Take it with you? Good luck with that.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1615096937, "downvotes": 5, "edited_utc": 1615097239, "fullname": "t3_sjkz", "guild_id": "1", "herald_guild": null, "id": "sjkz", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman/sjkz", "post_id": "87xp", "score": -1, "upvotes": 5, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["sjkz"], "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman/sjlu", "post": {"author_name": "JosephGoebbels", "award_count": 1, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 66, "created_utc": 1615090243, "domain": "files.catbox.moe", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_87xp", "guild_id": "1", "guild_name": "general", "herald_guild": null, "id": "87xp", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman", "score": 19, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/87xp/thumb.png", "title": "She thinks she's the first woman he's encountered.

You expect to be able to hook up with someone after you broke up with them??? Dude dodged a bullet.</p>\n<p>I mean, I get it. No one wants to marry a NEET, but it sounds like for her that was an excuse to cover up the fact that she was upset he didn't spend money on her. People are judging him and saying he should have tried harder to present himself as someone who was financially stable enough to start a family, but I kind of disagree. We are just hearing her side of the story and she's obviously nuts. It's very possible that he did, and if she was looking for a simple, frugal but stable life (instead of lusting after her friend's life who owns 3 properties) she would have been happy to stay with him.</p>\n<p>But that is just speculation of course. Maybe he needs to be clearer about his financial stability. (Like instead of \"I run a few websites\" be honest and say, \"I inherited this land that I lease out to some people. It's enough to live off of and I'm happy with my current, simple lifestyle.\")</p>\n", "created_utc": 1615130600, "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_skcg", "guild_id": "1", "herald_guild": null, "id": "skcg", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman/skcg", "post_id": "87xp", "score": 1, "upvotes": 3, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["skcg"], "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman/skf0", "post": {"author_name": "JosephGoebbels", "award_count": 1, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 66, "created_utc": 1615090243, "domain": "files.catbox.moe", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_87xp", "guild_id": "1", "guild_name": "general", "herald_guild": null, "id": "87xp", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+general/post/87xp/she-thinks-shes-the-first-woman", "score": 19, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/87xp/thumb.png", "title": "She thinks she's the first woman he's encountered.
