Given the browser becomes a need and integral part of an OS, I can go through windows and give you a list of \"non-operating system\" software, as well as Linux, to boil it down to a core that makes the OS not worth purchasing. Linux could easily package a browser in their distros, So could IBM OS/2 Warp. Limiting what a developer may offer in their package is anti-commerce &amp; anti-freedom. NO ! Gates committed much more grievous crimes, much earlier in his career, like stealing DoS and Windows. Integrating a browser into the OS is not a crime. 'Forcing' vendors to deploy PCs with Windows is the real crime, not only that, but many hardware brands build FOR windows &amp; a majority of manufacturers build windows tech. into the Bios (keys &amp; secure boot).</p>\n", "created_utc": 1616016524, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_tg7p", "guild_id": "1dn", "herald_guild": null, "id": "tg7p", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 8, "parent_comment_id": ["t4h0"], "permalink": "/+CancelCulture/post/8dq1/twitter-bans-posting-any-links-from/tg7p", "post_id": "8dq1", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["tg7p"], "permalink": "/+CancelCulture/post/8dq1/twitter-bans-posting-any-links-from/thz0", "post": {"author_name": "sqeptiq", "award_count": 0, "body": "> Big Tech platform Twitter has blocked posting any content from video streaming service BitChute, with an Orwellian prompt displaying any time that any user tries to post a BitChute link.\r\n\r\n> Twitter doesn\u2019t identify their \u201cpartners\u201d who made the censorship demand.
