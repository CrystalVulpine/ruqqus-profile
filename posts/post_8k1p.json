Of course, this line of thinking is extremely offensive even to modern christians or conservatives. The mere concept that women need to be under an authority is enough to send a congregation into foaming-at-the-mouth fits, yet this is what the bible teaches, whether we dislike hearing it or not.\r\n\r\nYou are basing this whole line of thinking on a one-liner from 1 Timothy, one of the most heretical books in the bible, which was composed as part of a slapfight between the catholic fathers and Marcionites and attributed to Paul to counter Marcion (because Paul was his favorite apostle). Somehow women became associated with Marcionism and gnosticism at some point in the second century, with Marcion possibly having been a woman named Marcellina, so the church decided that women are inherently more evil than men just to ruffle Marcion's feathes. It seems the early church was more concerned with winning against Marcion than defending the truth, and unfortunately they've had us fooled for thousands of years longer than they even intended. You would be absolutely appalled and disgusted if you heard of Deborah, Ruth, Mary Magdalene, or countless others. And you wouldn't like the gospels either, Jesus supports eunuchs and says we will be like the angels in the resurrection, almost certainly implying genderlessness.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Also many modern christians make the mistake, mostly because they are told falsehoods and are raised in a very feminized society, that women will just naturally submit to a man who exhibits christ-like virtues, but nothing could be further from the truth.
