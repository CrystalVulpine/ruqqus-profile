It\u2019s even harder to investigate accusations that her aides conspired to frame and imprison someone who had become a political problem for her. The Alex Salmond affair has shown the many ways the public prosecutors in the Crown Office, led by a member of Sturgeon\u2019s cabinet, have sought to censor and redact his allegations.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is immune to the threats and menaces of government lawyers. The notion of parliamentary privilege, a corner-stone of British democracy, means that anything can be said within the walls of parliament without fear of prosecution. David Davis, a senior Tory MP and lifelong member of the political awkward squad, this week took advantage of that privilege to give a no-holds-barred version of the Salmond story \u2014 including new allegations. Under British law, the notion of parliamentary privilege is extended to publications, so The Spectator cannot come under legal attack for reporting what is said in parliament.\r\n\r\nHere is what we now know. Salmond has suggested that the criminal allegations against him (he was acquitted of 13 charges of sexual abuse) were at least in part drummed up by Sturgeon\u2019s allies in the face of impeding defeat in the judicial review and to remove him from public life. Sturgeon denies she and her allies were out to get him. But her defence has been littered with contradictions.\r\n\r\nScotland\u2019s Crown Office is doing a clear-up job, seeking to expunge Salmond\u2019s evidence from the internet\r\nFor instance, she said she only found out about allegations against Salmond in early April 2018, when the internal inquiry was already under way. But Davis read the content of a message between civil servants heading the investigation into Salmond, which described \u2018interference\u2019 in the complaints process by Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon\u2019s chief of staff. It was sent on 6 February 2018. If this is true, it means we\u2019re to believe Ms Lloyd \u2014 who worked more closely with Ms Sturgeon than anyone \u2014 gave no hint about the bombshell allegations against Salmond for two months. We\u2019re also asked to believe that Sturgeon\u2019s husband, the SNP\u2019s chief executive, told her nothing about them either.\r\n\r\nWhen Salmond published his evidence, journalists were given legal advice not to report important parts of it. To do so, ran the argument, would violate a court order preventing the naming of complainants. Salmond\u2019s evidence names no one, so we published it on our website (with one redaction to address this concern).\r\n\r\nWe duly received a threatening letter from the Crown Office in Edinburgh, so we went to the High Court in Edinburgh and sought clarification: was there any legal impediment to The Spectator repeating the Salmond allegations? This mattered, because a Holyrood committee was also investigating them and wanted to publish Salmond\u2019s evidence too. The High Court raised no complaint about the publication, thereby giving the green light to the parliamentary inquiry. Salmond\u2019s evidence was published by Holyrood too, after which the Crown Office censors swooped on Holyrood and bullied parliament into withdrawing the evidence.\r\n\r\nWe can now disclose that the Crown Office is doing a clear-up job, seeking to expunge remnants of Salmond\u2019s evidence from the internet. It has ordered The Spectator to make further redactions to the Salmond submission. If we fail to comply, we have been advised that we could face penalties in excess of \u00a350,000 (there is no cap), plus huge legal costs we would not recoup even if we win in court. It\u2019s quite a risk, so we must consider removing Salmond\u2019s evidence from our website.\r\n\r\nWe take solace in the fact it has been available for all to read for many weeks now, and especially over the crucial period when Salmond and Sturgeon gave evidence to the Holyrood inquiry. This underlines the absurdity of the Crown Office\u2019s jackboot approach to a free press, in pursuit of an agenda which suits its political masters.\r\n\r\nHappily, the original text remains published by an internet archive service in California, which permanently stores internet pages. This service is valued by researchers who seek originals of documents censored by authoritarian regimes. The Crown Office, as part of its clean-up operation, told us to delete this version too. Luckily this is not in our gift.\r\n\r\nThe Spectator opened its first editorial in 1828 with the credo written by its founding editor, a Dundonian named R.S. Rintoul: \u2018The principal object of a newspaper is to convey intelligence.\u2019 The principal object of the Crown Office has not only been to stop intelligence being conveyed, but to delete intelligence from the public domain.\r\n\r\nThe hurdle in front of The Spectator now is great. The Crown Office even told us not to tell readers about its demand \u2014 but we can\u2019t be silent about its mendacious threats to a free press. Even if we end up succumbing to its censorship, we can still put its methods on record.\r\n\r\nThis is how the SNP government and its supine supporters operate. The recently passed Hate Crime Act gives them even more powers to menace the press. Scotland is being ushered towards an era of censorship, threats and state repression.

It\u2019s even harder to investigate accusations that her aides conspired to frame and imprison someone who had become a political problem for her. The Alex Salmond affair has shown the many ways the public prosecutors in the Crown Office, led by a member of Sturgeon\u2019s cabinet, have sought to censor and redact his allegations.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is immune to the threats and menaces of government lawyers. The notion of parliamentary privilege, a corner-stone of British democracy, means that anything can be said within the walls of parliament without fear of prosecution. David Davis, a senior Tory MP and lifelong member of the political awkward squad, this week took advantage of that privilege to give a no-holds-barred version of the Salmond story \u2014 including new allegations. Under British law, the notion of parliamentary privilege is extended to publications, so The Spectator cannot come under legal attack for reporting what is said in parliament.\r\n\r\nHere is what we now know. Salmond has suggested that the criminal allegations against him (he was acquitted of 13 charges of sexual abuse) were at least in part drummed up by Sturgeon\u2019s allies in the face of impeding defeat in the judicial review and to remove him from public life. Sturgeon denies she and her allies were out to get him. But her defence has been littered with contradictions.\r\n\r\nScotland\u2019s Crown Office is doing a clear-up job, seeking to expunge Salmond\u2019s evidence from the internet\r\nFor instance, she said she only found out about allegations against Salmond in early April 2018, when the internal inquiry was already under way. But Davis read the content of a message between civil servants heading the investigation into Salmond, which described \u2018interference\u2019 in the complaints process by Liz Lloyd, Sturgeon\u2019s chief of staff. It was sent on 6 February 2018. If this is true, it means we\u2019re to believe Ms Lloyd \u2014 who worked more closely with Ms Sturgeon than anyone \u2014 gave no hint about the bombshell allegations against Salmond for two months. We\u2019re also asked to believe that Sturgeon\u2019s husband, the SNP\u2019s chief executive, told her nothing about them either.\r\n\r\nWhen Salmond published his evidence, journalists were given legal advice not to report important parts of it. To do so, ran the argument, would violate a court order preventing the naming of complainants. Salmond\u2019s evidence names no one, so we published it on our website (with one redaction to address this concern).\r\n\r\nWe duly received a threatening letter from the Crown Office in Edinburgh, so we went to the High Court in Edinburgh and sought clarification: was there any legal impediment to The Spectator repeating the Salmond allegations? This mattered, because a Holyrood committee was also investigating them and wanted to publish Salmond\u2019s evidence too. The High Court raised no complaint about the publication, thereby giving the green light to the parliamentary inquiry. Salmond\u2019s evidence was published by Holyrood too, after which the Crown Office censors swooped on Holyrood and bullied parliament into withdrawing the evidence.\r\n\r\nWe can now disclose that the Crown Office is doing a clear-up job, seeking to expunge remnants of Salmond\u2019s evidence from the internet. It has ordered The Spectator to make further redactions to the Salmond submission. If we fail to comply, we have been advised that we could face penalties in excess of \u00a350,000 (there is no cap), plus huge legal costs we would not recoup even if we win in court. It\u2019s quite a risk, so we must consider removing Salmond\u2019s evidence from our website.\r\n\r\nWe take solace in the fact it has been available for all to read for many weeks now, and especially over the crucial period when Salmond and Sturgeon gave evidence to the Holyrood inquiry. This underlines the absurdity of the Crown Office\u2019s jackboot approach to a free press, in pursuit of an agenda which suits its political masters.\r\n\r\nHappily, the original text remains published by an internet archive service in California, which permanently stores internet pages. This service is valued by researchers who seek originals of documents censored by authoritarian regimes. The Crown Office, as part of its clean-up operation, told us to delete this version too. Luckily this is not in our gift.\r\n\r\nThe Spectator opened its first editorial in 1828 with the credo written by its founding editor, a Dundonian named R.S. Rintoul: \u2018The principal object of a newspaper is to convey intelligence.\u2019 The principal object of the Crown Office has not only been to stop intelligence being conveyed, but to delete intelligence from the public domain.\r\n\r\nThe hurdle in front of The Spectator now is great. The Crown Office even told us not to tell readers about its demand \u2014 but we can\u2019t be silent about its mendacious threats to a free press. Even if we end up succumbing to its censorship, we can still put its methods on record.\r\n\r\nThis is how the SNP government and its supine supporters operate. The recently passed Hate Crime Act gives them even more powers to menace the press. Scotland is being ushered towards an era of censorship, threats and state repression.
