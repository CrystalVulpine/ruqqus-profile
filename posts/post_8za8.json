If the bride is, say, a whore of unfaithful that represents idolatry. Of course, in this context I would be tempted to say the speakers represent the trinity abomination, but I've encountered these figures of three before, and I'll refrain from interpretating it. You didn't hear what the speakers were saying at all? \n\nAnother important symbol you should keep in mind for yourself is that clothes of garments represent sin.

Americanized Christianity and Evangelicalicism tend to be a product of the revivalist movements, instead of mainline Protestantism, which is why Americanized Christianity is so detached from mainline Christianity and Christian history. That's why you have all these 19th century sects like SDA, JWs, Mormonism (not exactly Christianity, but a product of it), Southern Baptists, etc. (I think they're all 19th century). Some of these sects hold to a restorationalist theology -- the idea that mainline Christianity went astray and they are restoring it to its original. \n\nAnyway, in the main fold of American para-Protestantism you find these nondenominational churches, Evangelicalism in various forms, mega churches, televangelists, self-professed \"born agains\", Southern Baptists, etc. What these have in common is that they believe they follow \", biblical\" Christianity and \"the Bible\" alone, and think of themselves as some kind of descendents in faith of the earliers Christian communities. \n\nThe problem is, that's not even remotely close to Luther's original concept of sola scriptura. Sola scriptura don't mean that there's a self-existing, self-canonized book called \"the Bible\" that is \"God's word\" detached from tradition. When the Reformation started the canon hadn't even been officially closed, and Luther initially wanted to remove James, Jude, Hebrews and Revelation from the Latin Vulgate which would became the by-default Bible of Western Christianity. The Protestants also didn't want to found a new church, and acknowledged the creeds of the Nicene Church and at least four of the seven ecumenical councils. \n\nThis is the root cause of all the confussion of American Evangelicalism. They claim \"the Bible\" was never compiled and canonized, never subject to tradition, the gospels were never titled and Catholics are not \"real\" Christians. Evangelicals and the false teachers and clown that lead them, don't know basic Christian history, basic Christian theology and most of the of course don't know a word of Greek or Hebrew (the very very few that do know only Greek). They also claim that the Bible is \"inspired\" because it's \"inspired\", it's \"God's word\" because it's \"God's word\" (it's all circular nonsense). And since they falsely claim in can't contradict itself (being \"God's word\") and only contains one singular narrative, they pick the narrative they prefer, and call the rest false teachers. \n\nAnyway, it's not just that Evangelicals claim to reject tradition, they don't period, but since they don't know anything about Christian history or theology, they keep using terminology they've inherited, without knowing where it comes from or what it means. They worship the trinity abomination based on the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed alone, but claim to reject it conception and only doctrinal basis. They still use and misuse Nicene terminology like \"person\", \"being\" and \"essence\", but they don't know where it comes from or what it means. They use the formula \"fully man and fully God\" without know that's the Chalcedonian definition, adopted at the Council of Chalcedon 451 AD, based on the christology of Pope Leo I. The correct term is \"truly man, truly God\", but, like with everything, they don't even understand the concepts they've inherited and bastardized. \n\nThis is the problem with American Evangelicalism.

Americanized Christianity and Evangelicalicism tend to be a product of the revivalist movements, instead of mainline Protestantism, which is why Americanized Christianity is so detached from mainline Christianity and Christian history. That's why you have all these 19th century sects like SDA, JWs, Mormonism (not exactly Christianity, but a product of it), Southern Baptists, etc. (I think they're all 19th century). Some of these sects hold to a restorationalist theology -- the idea that mainline Christianity went astray and they are restoring it to its original. \n\nAnyway, in the main fold of American para-Protestantism you find these nondenominational churches, Evangelicalism in various forms, mega churches, televangelists, self-professed \"born agains\", Southern Baptists, etc. What these have in common is that they believe they follow \", biblical\" Christianity and \"the Bible\" alone, and think of themselves as some kind of descendents in faith of the earliers Christian communities. \n\nThe problem is, that's not even remotely close to Luther's original concept of sola scriptura. Sola scriptura don't mean that there's a self-existing, self-canonized book called \"the Bible\" that is \"God's word\" detached from tradition. When the Reformation started the canon hadn't even been officially closed, and Luther initially wanted to remove James, Jude, Hebrews and Revelation from the Latin Vulgate which would became the by-default Bible of Western Christianity. The Protestants also didn't want to found a new church, and acknowledged the creeds of the Nicene Church and at least four of the seven ecumenical councils. \n\nThis is the root cause of all the confussion of American Evangelicalism. They claim \"the Bible\" was never compiled and canonized, never subject to tradition, the gospels were never titled and Catholics are not \"real\" Christians. Evangelicals and the false teachers and clown that lead them, don't know basic Christian history, basic Christian theology and most of the of course don't know a word of Greek or Hebrew (the very very few that do know only Greek). They also claim that the Bible is \"inspired\" because it's \"inspired\", it's \"God's word\" because it's \"God's word\" (it's all circular nonsense). And since they falsely claim in can't contradict itself (being \"God's word\") and only contains one singular narrative, they pick the narrative they prefer, and call the rest false teachers. \n\nAnyway, it's not just that Evangelicals claim to reject tradition, they don't period, but since they don't know anything about Christian history or theology, they keep using terminology they've inherited, without knowing where it comes from or what it means. They worship the trinity abomination based on the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed alone, but claim to reject it conception and only doctrinal basis. They still use and misuse Nicene terminology like \"person\", \"being\" and \"essence\", but they don't know where it comes from or what it means. They use the formula \"fully man and fully God\" without know that's the Chalcedonian definition, adopted at the Council of Chalcedon 451 AD, based on the christology of Pope Leo I.
