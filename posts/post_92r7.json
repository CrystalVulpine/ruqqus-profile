They would be regarded as corrupted silver.\n\nThe Bible don't lie, bruh. God knows everything and tells us.","body_html":"<p>Isaiah predicted the coming of Christ. Isaiah told the Israelites that God would use Jesus to bring the Gentiles to worship God.</p>\n<p>Isaiah does say this as he condemns the Israelites. But it seems to me that he doesn't say that he means to say that the Israelites don't hold their laws well enough. He says that the Israelites don't feed the world with the grace of God, and it makes God hate their supposed acts of \"obedience\".</p>\n<p>Isaiah says that the Israelites will be punished but the savior of the Gentiles will eventually bring kings of all nations to bring treasures to Jerusalem in honor of God. The Israelites thought that God would send a savior to enslave the nations of the world to Israel. But that's retarded because God frees Israel from the Egyptians and told them not to take slaves (he told them to slaughter their enemies).</p>\n<p>God had planned for the Israelites to be idiots because ALL people are like this because of the fall of man. But we know that God had a plan for the Edomites when he blessed Esau from birth, but less so than Jacob.</p>\n<p>God always had a plan to bless the Gentiles. And Isaiah actually speaks that the Gentiles may end up being blessed more in some circumstances than the Israelites, but that the treasures of the Gentiles would provide for Jerusalem as the city of Zion. The Gentiles would become an extension of God's hands as the Israelites were prior to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Remember also that not all Israelites were the children of David, and God specifically seeks to bless the children of David because he promised his servant David that his kin would rule the world. That was the tribe of Judah, which was kept in Jerusalem while the rest of the tribes were scattered. But he told Judah that while Judah would be preserved, it would always be a lesser power on God's Earth. Always subservient to Israelites elsewhere. It's why Jerusalem is still a lesser power riding on the coattails of other Christian nations. And other Christian nations provide their treaures to build the walls of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>But as God said to Judah, they would be amongst the most rebellious people to God.
