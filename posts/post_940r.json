How about God is a balanced mix?</p>\n<p>Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10), but perfect charity (love) casteth out fear (1 John 4:18). We fear God because God is all powerful and will punish people if they do wrong (or could), but after developing this respect for God's power and choosing to be good then we can love God. It's like working with a power tool like a saw - you could cut your hand so you want to be careful, but if you respect the power of the tool's ability to cut you, then you can develop a love of working with the tool.</p>\n","created_utc":1617209814,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_uqli","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"uqli","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["uq5y"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/940r/do-you-believe-that-every-depiction/uqli","post_id":"940r","score":6,"upvotes":6,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["uqli"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/940r/do-you-believe-that-every-depiction/uqw9","post":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"Is the Old Testament literally correct?

(Yes, I believe in personal assurance of salvation, but I can only minister to others in faith that God can use my efforts as he pleases.)</p>\n<p>And re: romans 9, I partially agree with your take, in that he is talking about groups of people, but he illustrates the nature of the groups by using examples of individuals in relation to God's choice.  In other words, Paul isn't using his character examples symbolically or \"representatively\".  I think over all he's clearly talking about the Jews/Gentiles AND the Elect (v24) which is composed not of those who choose salvation on their own (no one can as Paul has explained), but of those that God mercifully chooses (v16).</p>\n","created_utc":1617334149,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_uvks","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"uvks","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":17,"parent_comment_id":["uv7s"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/940r/do-you-believe-that-every-depiction/uvks","post_id":"940r","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["uvks"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/940r/do-you-believe-that-every-depiction/ux0b","post":{"author_name":"ArchibaldCoolstep","award_count":0,"body":"Is the Old Testament literally correct?
