Joan of Arc famously cross-dressed, wearing men’s armor in the 15th century as a deterrent to rape (and was eventually burned at the stake in part because of this). By 1850, Amelia Bloomer, a women’s rights activist, popularized the “bloomer” pant, those baggy, knee- or ankle-length trousers Elizabeth Smith Miller created. By the 20th century, women’s pants were appropriate for “occasional dressing only,” worn at designated times as hostess pajamas or bicycling pants, Emma McClendon, associate costume curator at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. By the 1920s and 30s, celebrities like Marlene Dietrich dared to wear full pantsuits to movie premieres (Dietrich’s came courtesy Gabrielle Chanel), and the “most daring thing about Katharine Hepburn” was her pants.\n\n> McClendon points out that as celebrities, both of those women could get away with wearing androgynous looks without repercussions, while ordinary women elsewhere would have been fined, thanks to laws enacted by men. In France, women needed permission to “dress like a man” to work or ride bicycles or horses, a law that remained intact until 2013 (though it hadn’t been seriously enforced in more than a century.) In 1939, a Los Angeles woman went to jail for wearing slacks to court, the judge citing them as a distraction from the ongoing legal business at hand. Women in the United States Congress were barred from wearing pants on the Senate floor until the 1993 “Pantsuit Rebellion” overturned the archaic rule.\n\n> It’d be naive to think women’s garb isn’t policed in the new millennia: In 2009, a Sudanese woman was fined (but avoided whipping) for wearing green slacks, which violated “public decency laws”; a rule adopted in 2017 for women pro golfers stipulated they could be fined for wearing leggings; and, speaking of leggings, some now see them as the anti-pants pants — as oppressive as corsets and gowns, according to one New York Times opinion writer, whose recent “yoga pants are bad for women” Op-Ed ignited controversy around the matter. You get the idea.\n\nAgain as history.com notes, Joan of Arc was [put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft and violating divine law for dressing like a man](https://www.history.com/news/joan-arc-burned-stake) - so it was seen for a long time as being wrong for women to dress like men (and wearing pants would probably fall in to being a violation of that).\n\n> And why doesn't the same principle apply for men?\n\nIf it doesn't apply, it may be because there is a legit double standard and women and men are different.

It's been the clothing style of a rebellious feminist culture.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapper\n\n> Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts (just at the knee was short for that time period), bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes in public, driving automobiles, treating [reproduction] in a casual manner, and otherwise flouting social [and reproductive] norms.[1]\n\n[The History Of Women Wearing Pants As Power Symbol](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-history-of-women-wearing-pants-as-power-symbol_n_5a99bb95e4b0a0ba4ad34fe7)\n\n> Off the runway, retailer Ann Taylor is launching its “Pants Are Power” campaign on March 1, which, the company says, “commemorates the evolution of pants not only in fashion, but as a symbol of equality for women,” and making the question of “who wears the pants?” in a relationship seem more than metaphorical.\n\n> Of course, women wearing pants is only newly socially acceptable (in a society controlled by the patriarchy), relatively speaking. Joan of Arc famously cross-dressed, wearing men’s armor in the 15th century as a deterrent to rape (and was eventually burned at the stake in part because of this). By 1850, Amelia Bloomer, a women’s rights activist, popularized the “bloomer” pant, those baggy, knee- or ankle-length trousers Elizabeth Smith Miller created. By the 20th century, women’s pants were appropriate for “occasional dressing only,” worn at designated times as hostess pajamas or bicycling pants, Emma McClendon, associate costume curator at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. By the 1920s and 30s, celebrities like Marlene Dietrich dared to wear full pantsuits to movie premieres (Dietrich’s came courtesy Gabrielle Chanel), and the “most daring thing about Katharine Hepburn” was her pants.\n\n> McClendon points out that as celebrities, both of those women could get away with wearing androgynous looks without repercussions, while ordinary women elsewhere would have been fined, thanks to laws enacted by men.

Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes in public, driving automobiles, treating [reproduction] in a casual manner, and otherwise flouting social [and reproductive] norms.[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-history-of-women-wearing-pants-as-power-symbol_n_5a99bb95e4b0a0ba4ad34fe7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The History Of Women Wearing Pants As Power Symbol</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Off the runway, retailer Ann Taylor is launching its “Pants Are Power” campaign on March 1, which, the company says, “commemorates the evolution of pants not only in fashion, but as a symbol of equality for women,” and making the question of “who wears the pants?” in a relationship seem more than metaphorical.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, women wearing pants is only newly socially acceptable (in a society controlled by the patriarchy), relatively speaking. Joan of Arc famously cross-dressed, wearing men’s armor in the 15th century as a deterrent to rape (and was eventually burned at the stake in part because of this). By 1850, Amelia Bloomer, a women’s rights activist, popularized the “bloomer” pant, those baggy, knee- or ankle-length trousers Elizabeth Smith Miller created. By the 20th century, women’s pants were appropriate for “occasional dressing only,” worn at designated times as hostess pajamas or bicycling pants, Emma McClendon, associate costume curator at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. By the 1920s and 30s, celebrities like Marlene Dietrich dared to wear full pantsuits to movie premieres (Dietrich’s came courtesy Gabrielle Chanel), and the “most daring thing about Katharine Hepburn” was her pants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>McClendon points out that as celebrities, both of those women could get away with wearing androgynous looks without repercussions, while ordinary women elsewhere would have been fined, thanks to laws enacted by men.

Moreover, do you think God wants people to be making rock music?</p>\n<p>In contrast, music approved for church might be an example of music that wouldn't be problematic - if there are doubts about rock music, would it be better to try to find music you have no doubts about?</p>\n<p>Are you persuaded by rock music and other musics being bad, or if not what is your problem with it?</p>\n","comment_count":28,"created_utc":1618246934,"domain":"text post","downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_9psl","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"9psl","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/9psl/does-anyone-feel-rock-music-is","score":5,"thumb_url":null,"title":"Does Anyone Feel \"Rock Music Is The Devil\"?","upvotes":5,"url":""},"post_id":"9psl","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
