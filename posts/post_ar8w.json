If you live in the US, you generally maim your pets because you don't want to have to love them as they are. You want to love them for how you want them to be.\n\nI feel like it is shameful to maim God's creation unnecessarily, but God told Adam to build a garden out of His creation, and tend to it as he wants, only propagating plants that are pleasing to him. And He tells the Israelites to systematically sacrifice lambs, but not their own children. Except that God puts this fate on His own son.\n\nRemember that no sin is irredeemable, though. People hurt people they love all the time, sometimes in permanent ways. We do things out of love that are very hateful because we don't know how to love unless we learn it from God first.
