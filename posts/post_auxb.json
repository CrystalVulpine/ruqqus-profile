He was made to reprove our thoughts; he is grievous unto us even to behold, for his life is not like other men's; his ways are of another fashion.

What's to prevent the same from happening with anyone else?\r\n\r\n> The Holy Spirit may guide me, but how can a solid foundation be built without a reliable concrete source?\r\n\r\nThis is, at its root, a lack of faith. Sometimes you will make wrong judgements, but so did the writers of those books, and that's why they also contain errors, and they actually condemn each other more than you have been led to believe (Actually, you have to make more of your own judgements relying solely on written text. Like how a law says what it says, but the judge who decides its meaning is infinitely more important). But you can't trust the spirit, so you put your trust in a book instead. Everyone has that longing for something to look up to, and when they reject it they try to fill it with something else (idolatry), and in many cases it's the Bible.\r\n\r\n> I mean, how do you decide what has been altered? Do you just pick and choose what sounds right to you and toss out the rest?\r\n\r\nThere's actually more room for cherry picking as it stands, because you have to pick one set of teachings that you like and find a clever way to interpret away the contradicting ones. Interestingly most who do this rarely opt for what Jesus taught.\r\n\r\n> But if we could innately know what is right or wrong then why are we so much better at justifying wrong behavior than right?\r\n\r\nBecause we choose to, and reject the spirit. I cannot say that sola scriptura abiding Christians are any better than a non-believer at making moral judgements, they only make different ones.\r\n\r\n> There has to be some reliable foundation that we can compare ourselves to.\r\n\r\nThe spirit is reliable. The trouble with this is that humans want defined sets of rules, they crave structure and order, otherwise they feel insecure. Most will even tolerate a dictatorship if it satisfies this craving. Thus raw moral principles and acting on a case by case basis, and especially communication with a higher power, is not attractive to most. It's also not as easy to judge others by, which creatures are also hardwired to want because getting others harmed or punished reduces competition and increases their own chances of survival.

What's to prevent the same from happening with anyone else?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Holy Spirit may guide me, but how can a solid foundation be built without a reliable concrete source?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is, at its root, a lack of faith. Sometimes you will make wrong judgements, but so did the writers of those books, and that's why they also contain errors, and they actually condemn each other more than you have been led to believe (Actually, you have to make more of your own judgements relying solely on written text. Like how a law says what it says, but the judge who decides its meaning is infinitely more important). But you can't trust the spirit, so you put your trust in a book instead. Everyone has that longing for something to look up to, and when they reject it they try to fill it with something else (idolatry), and in many cases it's the Bible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mean, how do you decide what has been altered? Do you just pick and choose what sounds right to you and toss out the rest?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's actually more room for cherry picking as it stands, because you have to pick one set of teachings that you like and find a clever way to interpret away the contradicting ones. Interestingly most who do this rarely opt for what Jesus taught.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if we could innately know what is right or wrong then why are we so much better at justifying wrong behavior than right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because we choose to, and reject the spirit. I cannot say that sola scriptura abiding Christians are any better than a non-believer at making moral judgements, they only make different ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There has to be some reliable foundation that we can compare ourselves to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The spirit is reliable. The trouble with this is that humans want defined sets of rules, they crave structure and order, otherwise they feel insecure. Most will even tolerate a dictatorship if it satisfies this craving. Thus raw moral principles and acting on a case by case basis, and especially communication with a higher power, is not attractive to most. It's also not as easy to judge others by, which creatures are also hardwired to want because getting others harmed or punished reduces competition and increases their own chances of survival. And it doesn't allow for loopholes.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1620573308, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_xtr8", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/jesuschrist/banner-3.png", "color": "#2A96F3", "created_utc": 1596060787, "description": "This guild is to serve as a communication medium for fellow believers.
