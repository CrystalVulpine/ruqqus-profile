Whole western Europe is being destroyed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People have been saying that for 2000 years. I guess they want to be a part of something exciting and hope it all happens in their lifetime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You are right. However, now we can clearly see how the stage is getting ready to bring us the sign of the beast from revelation. How I see it, there are two options. This whole covid operation will eventually come to an end and we'll wait for another time that will remind us again of what is written in Revelation. I honestly don't think this will happen, but it is possible. And the other possibility is that covid tyranny will spread even further, the pandemic will never end, and social credit system will be implemented all over world, together with digital ID's and neural implants. And I personally see this as really probable (With how they push the great reset, they don't plan us to return to our previous lives), and therefore I think that the 2nd coming is really close. From things I've read about I think that the seven years from Revelation will begin during next 10 years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>like a thief in the night means like a thief in the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don' believe that the 2nd coming of Jesus will be something that nobody is going to even think of happening. I think this is more about not knowing the exact date when He will come, but I'm sure that people who can see things in context will be able to guess the period of time, when it's going to happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that God would be so unforgiving as to deceive people to keep them from being saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think you understand how that works. The delusion is aimed at people who refused to believe the truth. They are people who decided that they don't want to be saved by Jesus, so He lets them walk on that way. And it is important to point out, that God doesn't send delusion to anyone. He just wont stop the devil from overtaking these people completely.</p>\n","created_utc":1620486497,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_xr6d","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"xr6d","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent_comment_id":["xq8s"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/b2ss/some-german-parishes-plan-blessings-for/xr6d","post_id":"b2ss","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["xr6d"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/b2ss/some-german-parishes-plan-blessings-for/xshq","post":{"author_name":"Decaf","award_count":0,"body":"","body_html":"","comment_count":34,"created_utc":1620087758,"domain":"ncronline.org","downvotes":2,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_b2ss","guild_id":"41","guild_name":"Christianity","herald_guild":null,"id":"b2ss","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"Catholic chaplains in parishes across Germany plan to invite people to \"blessing services for lovers\" on and around May 10.\n\nThe campaign, \"Love Wins,\" was launched in Hamburg, reported the German Cat...","meta_title":"Some German parishes plan blessings for lovers, including lesbian and gay couples | National Catholic Reporter","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/b2ss/some-german-parishes-plan-blessings-for","score":7,"thumb_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/b2ss/thumb.png","title":"Some German parishes plan blessings for lovers, including lesbian and gay couples","upvotes":9,"url":"https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/some-german-parishes-plan-blessings-lovers-including-lesbian-and-gay-couples"},"post_id":"b2ss","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
