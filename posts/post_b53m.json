At the end of his life, in the presence of his disciples, he spoke these dreadful words: \"Out of one hundred thousand people whose lives have always been bad, you will find barely one who is worthy of indulgence.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of sermon is intended to act as a \"wake up call\" to those who are being reassured that, while they live bad lives, their lives are actually \"not so bad\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pious souls, you may leave; this sermon is not for you. Its sole purpose is to contain the pride of libertines who cast the holy fear of God out of their heart and join forces with the devil who, according to the sentiment of Eusebius, damns souls by reassuring them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is not intended to discourage people towards sins of despair, but rather encourage people to be the very best they can be, to \"strive\" to do so. As the sermon states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of our brothers, Blessed Giles, was in the habit of saying that if only one man were going to be damned, he would do all he could to make sure he was not that man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I imagine no one would like to be that man, but rather instead would like to act to not be such a person. A house is secured against dangers of thieves breaking in, or animals and pests, or natural disasters. So too our souls are subject to dangers of temptation and one would think that a man thinking like \"Blessed Giles\" would seek to secure the soul against such dangers by prayer, fasting, almsgiving, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that you may obtain. 1 Corinthians 9:24</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully sermons like this inspire good people to be the very best they can be, and bad people to become good, that they may train just as athletes in a contest so that they may obtain the \"prize\" of eternal life.</p>\n<p>Sermon text link: <a href=\"https://www.olrl.org/snt_docs/fewness.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.olrl.org/snt_docs/fewness.shtml</a></p>\n", "comment_count": 6, "created_utc": 1620316417, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_b53m", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "b53m", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/b53m/the-fewness-of-the-saved-sermon", "score": 5, "thumb_url": null, "title": "\"The Fewness Of The Saved\" Sermon By St. Leonard Of Port Maurice (And Comments)", "upvotes": 5, "url": ""}, "post_id": "b53m", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
