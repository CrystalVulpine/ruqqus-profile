I invited her over to a family get together last weekend--BBQ, firepit, some family games and what not. I made some snarky remark to my nephew (who I love to pick on, the little jerk--lol). He knew it was just Auntie Quantum, and he shot back at me (burned me good, too, the little shit--lol). But she got momentarily upset about my remark to him and begged me not to \"pick on him\". Dead serious. She had never had anyone tease her before without it coming from a place of cruelty. She actually said to me before she left, she had never seen a family like mine that played together and laughed and teased one another. That hit me right in the Feels.

She asked me again before coming over if my family would have an issue with it, and said she wouldn't wear it if it would make anyone feel awkward. No one had an issue with it, or even batted a lash (my family is pretty awesome). She was extremely kind and polite the entire time she was over, helped clean up before she left. She doesn't harp on and on about her \"furry\" persona...... She informed me of it, I said, Okay, whatever, and once in a blue moon she'll make a joking comment out her inner \"wolf\" and that's it. She doesn't wallow or rub your face in it. It's a part of her like having blue hair or wearing Goth clothes, but it's not a constant, unrelenting topic, if you know what I mean. Hell, she hasn't even admitted her parents abused her, I just picked up on it from observation and little things she's said in passing. \n\nSomeday, she's either going to commit suicide, or turn into a normal person. I hope it's the latter. I hope that by being kind to her, she sees that not everyone has to live the way she was brought up, and she can find, I don't know, something in herself worth saving and look forward to that's different than what she knows.
