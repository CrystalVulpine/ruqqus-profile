{"author":{"id":"1ww2","is_deleted":true,"permalink":"/@MysteryHunter","username":"MysteryHunter"},"author_name":null,"award_count":0,"body":"Levitical law was for the nation of Israel, the laws of the land when in God's country and one of God's citizen's (people). God did not want the Jews to go under his law, he wanted them to choose his grace instead. He even tried to show them that they were incapable of keeping the most simple of laws, and that his Grace provided everything they needed. But still, they chose to go under the law because they wanted to be self-righteous and not righteous in the eyes of God. \n\nJust like Adam and Eve were given the choice to from the forbidden tree, and Christians have the choice to accept or reject Jesus, the Jews were given the choice if they wanted Grace. God must provide us this choice otherwise we do not have free will, he doesn't want us to reject him, but it must be made available. It was impossible for them to keep the law from the very beginning due to them not having Grace, and the sin dwelling in their bodies. But they couldn't see that and chose to be under the law.\n\nMy point with that is we are under Grace, not under the law.\n\nRomans 6:14\nFor sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.\n\nNow of course that doesn't mean we should sin:\n\nRomans 6\n1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?\n2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\n\nAnd obviously things like murder and adultery are sins whether you live in Israel or not, but many of the Laws of Israel were just for israel. Not shaving the beards, not being able to wear more than 1 material like cotton in your clothes at a time, eating unclean animals like pork, stoning your children to death if they disobeyed. While these things were God's will and righteous for Israel, we are not under the law. They were a special nation that was not only under the law, but was to serve as an example to the rest of the world through their behavior and customs. So many of the laws were about being those representatives, God's physical people. But you and I are God's spiritual people, so the emphasis for us is not on our physical behaviors.\n\nMaybe you heard it said that we do not have a religion, we have a relationship with God? This is true, we don't have a religion. Israel was the only legitimate religion that had authorized rituals and customs in the history of the earth. We aren't told to attend church weekly or anything like that, spiritual guidances and things for our inner man to follow.\n\nAs for determining what was just for Israel and what isn't a sin for us, read the books written to Christians under grace, not Jews under the law. Romans through Philemon are our books written to a Christian audience. I'm not saying the 4 gospels or other books aren't for us, all scripture is profitable for learning, but their audience is a Jewish audience under different circumstances than us. That is why many feel they sometimes find contradictions in the bible, or think Christians desire to stone homosexuals to death. No I don't want to stone sinners to death, some violent criminals should be eliminated, but stoning people to death was for breaking the law. We are not under the law.\n\nNow last argument you could say all these things have spiritual truths to them or work from a health perspective, so we should follow them anyway even though we aren't required to. The thing is I argue with a lot of christians regarding tattoos. I wholeheartedly believe God does not want us to tattoo our skin that he has given us, and the Jews were told not to cut or make marking on their body. And I think that is God's will whether we are under the law or not, but since this is physical in nature, I can't say it's a sin for us. It's foolish and is mentally ill and God doesn't like it, but if Christians were instructed not to do this then we would have a \"religion\" and would not be the spiritual people that we are.\n\nSo this isn't something with a simple yes or no answer, I apologize for writing so much but I just want you to have a complex answer to a complex question so you can navigate this issue. Paul addresses this very thing, regarding those that believe we must follow things vs those that do not.\n\nActs 15 addresses Christians being told they needed to be circumcised to be saved and follow the laws etc. Paul handles this in a very complex manner. Elsewhere he addresses Christians believing they need to observe certain days, diets, moons too. And of course many believe they need water baptism to be saved as well. It's a common issue amongst Christians whether they need to do physical things. The answer is no, it's all by faith to receive God's grace, and many of these laws were for those that were under Israel law as part of their citizenship and birthright.\n\nIf you want to abstain from blood, pork, that is entirely your choice. You should not think it a sin to eat these things, and more important you should never judge a Christian that does these things because we aren't required to. Following the law concerning these things should never enter your mind, and we have greater ways to please God.\n\nAlso side note, Paul did tell Christians to abstain from blood drinking when in the presence of Jews, so they would not reject the Gospel message as a result of being offended by their actions or thinking they were violating the law or living contrary to it. This was so it would not cause the Jews to stumble, not because Christians are forbidden to do it. I realize fornication is there, Paul was really emphasising that it would be even more damaging than usual in their presence, not that it's ok to do elsewhere, but that it would gave grace consequences for their message.\n\nActs 15\n19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:\n20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.","body_html":"<p>Levitical law was for the nation of Israel, the laws of the land when in God's country and one of God's citizen's (people).
