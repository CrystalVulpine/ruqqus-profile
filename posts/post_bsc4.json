If you have been this way without change your whole life (or since puberty leveled out) then that's your normal and that's okay. If it's something that's changed, especially if it shifted suddenly, that's something you want to talk to your primary care about, and possibly a psychologist. \n\nHOWEVER I do think what you're describing can be normal. Different people have different normal levels of libido. And different facets of their personalities that some people think are weird. Eg: I don't have a huge grief response and I'm a cool cucumber in a crisis.

My kids aren't different because they're born of my body. They're different because they're in my care. If you have a nurturing instinct towards an infant or child, it can be generally towards all children. When caretaking the infant of my best friend I knew I'd fight tooth and nail (literally) for her. Not because she was my best friend's daughter, but because she was in my care.\r\n\r\nThat's usually only a male instinct since they have to rely on the woman to get their genes passed on. This is why virginity is so precious in a woman but often looked down upon as a weakness in a man.\r\n\r\n> And as far as romance goes I'm pretty similar. I'm a woman, so I'm slightly more romantic, but it's very low maintenance, \"tell me I'm pretty and rub my shoulders.\"kinda thing.\r\n\r\nThat's not necessarily a romantic action. Romance involves some kind of sexual energy, not just any kind of comfort or bonding.\r\n\r\n> Have you ever taken a myers briggs type indicator test? Mbti for short.

Apparently INTJ females are exceptionally rare.\r\n\r\nDoubtful, it's just socialized out of them. There is more pressure from society for men to behave a certain way and it's usually accepting of anything women do, but women also expect *each other* to act a certain way more than men do, and peer pressure is usually a lot more powerful than \"fine I'll do it because I have to\". Usually this is a very narrow set of girly behaviors that are allowed for you to fit into their social circle, otherwise you won't fit in at all. And talking to the other sex isn't an option because \"ALL MEN ARE RAPISTS REEEEEE!\" and men are also taught to be ashamed of anything associated with female and will tend to avoid contact unless it's romantic, so if a female decides not to act 100% stereotypical she'll be pretty stranded in the social circle.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Can it be normal?
