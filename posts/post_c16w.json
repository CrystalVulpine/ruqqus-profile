For example I bet you didn't know that:\r\n\r\n* The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)\r\n\r\n* Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)\r\n\r\n* God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)\r\n\r\n* Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)\r\n\r\n* Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\r\n\r\n* The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, *before* the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\r\n\r\nNow let's review 1 Timothy's \"biblical\" requirements:\r\n\r\n> Γυνὴ ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ μανθανέτω ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ· διδάσκειν δὲ γυναικὶ οὐκ ἐπιτρέπω, οὐδὲ αὐθεντεῖν ἀνδρός, ἀλλ’ εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ. Ἀδὰμ γὰρ πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη, εἶτα Εὔα. καὶ Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν· σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης.\r\n\r\nLiterally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital; 1 Corinthians 14:33b-35 is an abrupt insertion to the original letter. Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved, in direct contradiction not only to Jesus but also Paul himself in 1 Corinthians 7. To be fair it's possible this passage is also a later insertion, as it jumps quite profoundly from matters of decency to office qualifications, but it's more likely a bridging device for the next topic.\r\n\r\n> εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ. δεῖ οὖν τὸν ἐπίσκοπον ἀνεπίλημπτον εἶναι, μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα, νηφάλιον, σώφρονα, κόσμιον, φιλόξενον, διδακτικόν, μὴ πάροινον, μὴ πλήκτην, ἀλλὰ ἐπιεικῆ, ἄμαχον, ἀφιλάργυρον,\r\n\r\nThis criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.\r\n\r\n> τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου καλῶς προϊστάμενον, τέκνα ἔχοντα ἐν ὑποταγῇ μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος.\r\n\r\nThe next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\r\n\r\n> μὴ νεόφυτον, ἵνα μὴ τυφωθεὶς εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου.\r\n\r\nPaul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.\r\n\r\n> δεῖ δὲ καὶ μαρτυρίαν καλὴν ἔχειν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔξωθεν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ καὶ παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\r\n\r\n> Verse? What exactly contradicts this in Matthew 23?\r\n\r\nThe entire chapter.

They are even responsible for the crucifixion. It's always the same pattern: someone in power feels threatened by Christians and tries to execute the final solution.

Timothy was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium, and was specifically said to be taken with Paul as Acts continues, leading to a couple of undesigned coincidences. \n\n> Wouldn't it make like a LOT more sense to do that in a public letter? \n\nShould Paul have attempted to make an announcement rather than instruct a letter to his diciple?

For example I bet you didn't know that:\n\n> christian agrees with popular biblical interpretation, therefore hasn't read bible\n\n> The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)\n\n\"Copyists\" isn't synonymous with \"scribe.\" These were interpreters and, in their interpretations, essentially false teachers, a common idea in the bible.\n\n> Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)\n\n...Yeah?\n\n> God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)\n\nAlso concealed or deliberately mistranslated in Leviticus, Genesis, Hebrews...?\n\n> Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)\n\nHuh? \nDeuteronomy 17:14-15\nEven without the context of Deuteronomy, this is read as a very situational passage. Going into a passage, especially a situational one, with the intent to prove a point rather than find the original idea of the passage isn't going to be helpful.\n\n>Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\n\nIt's ironic. Though I'm accussed of only listening to my favorite televangelists, you made a claim from biblical critics and simply wrote \"are judged\" as though it's the consensus of biblical scholars. \n\n> The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, before the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\n\nThat just sounds like a stretch. Where did he declare the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot?\n\n> Literally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital\n\nConsidering various teachings of Jesus being new, why would teachings upon an almost completely new church be such an outrageous idea?\n\n> Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved.\n\nYes, \"literally\" in the sense of removing context to prove a point.\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Directly prior to the verse: For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.\n\n2. This is further mentioned in 1 Timothy 5:14-15: So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. For some have already strayed after Satan.\n\n3. In 1 Timothy 4:16: Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save (sozo) both yourself and your hearers. When in the context of it's own book, it certaintly does give more of a case to spiritual preservation rather than the \"not saving by faith\" idea, the idea that contradicts the church in the forgery \"decades after his death.\"\n\n> This criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.\n\nIt's almost as though it's to prevent the corruption of those who teach what they do not do, otherwise the teachers of the law in Jesus' time.\n\n> The next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\n\nLet's actually read what Paul said about marriage:\n\nNow concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\n\nTo the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.\n\nAgain, being accused of not reading the bible... though the idea that Paul wanted to keep church leaders from sexual immorality isn't even taken into consideration.\n\n> Paul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.\n\n...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?\n\n> This is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\n\nConsidering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.\n\n> Finally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\n\nEntire context and verse:\n\nThen Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\nWhile taking this section out of context, I wonder if \"call no man your father/instructor was taken literally as well...\nWhen we look at this scripture without a bias, and entirely in context, we find that these were all titles used to exalt instructors, and have a final consensus that we we should not exalt ourselves as the Pharisees were.\n\n> The entire chapter. You've been fooled yet again, this time into thinking that the bible is just a collection of a bunch of contextless sentences called verses. \n\nBelieve it or not, I understand the meaning of context. It also doesn't seem wise to read a whole chapter, see no stance against the allied argument, then decide the opposing argument must be true because they said \"It's the whole chapter!\"","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Come on.

Every one of those is a tyrant controlling everyone and squashing their opposition.

And one that actually matches his writing style and doesn't use words that didn't exist until decades after his death? It's pretty obvious that it's not legit. In order to fully understand the problem, you have to be aware of what Christianity looked like in those days. It was still full of wildly different beliefs, and the orthodoxy was just beginning to form and sought centralized control and an organized church for the first time. 1 Timothy is an early attempt to discredit ideas the church considered heresy (some of them rightfully but that's no excuse to defraud), and give the church leaders more power. 1 Timothy very specifically attacks schools of thought which did not surface until after Paul's death, specifically those which relied heavily on his authentic letters, and directly contradicts Paul and early Christianity many times.

Most of what people think the bible says is actually what their favorite televangelist told them it says. For example I bet you didn't know that:\r\n\r\n* The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)\r\n\r\n* Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)\r\n\r\n* God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)\r\n\r\n* Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)\r\n\r\n* Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\r\n\r\n* The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, *before* the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\r\n\r\nNow let's review 1 Timothy's \"biblical\" requirements:\r\n\r\n> Γυνὴ ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ μανθανέτω ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ· διδάσκειν δὲ γυναικὶ οὐκ ἐπιτρέπω, οὐδὲ αὐθεντεῖν ἀνδρός, ἀλλ’ εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ. Ἀδὰμ γὰρ πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη, εἶτα Εὔα. καὶ Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν· σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης.\r\n\r\nLiterally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital; 1 Corinthians 14:33b-35 is an abrupt insertion to the original letter. Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved, in direct contradiction not only to Jesus but also Paul himself in 1 Corinthians 7. To be fair it's possible this passage is also a later insertion, as it jumps quite profoundly from matters of decency to office qualifications, but it's more likely a bridging device for the next topic.\r\n\r\n> εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ. δεῖ οὖν τὸν ἐπίσκοπον ἀνεπίλημπτον εἶναι, μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα, νηφάλιον, σώφρονα, κόσμιον, φιλόξενον, διδακτικόν, μὴ πάροινον, μὴ πλήκτην, ἀλλὰ ἐπιεικῆ, ἄμαχον, ἀφιλάργυρον,\r\n\r\nThis criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.\r\n\r\n> τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου καλῶς προϊστάμενον, τέκνα ἔχοντα ἐν ὑποταγῇ μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος.\r\n\r\nThe next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\r\n\r\n> μὴ νεόφυτον, ἵνα μὴ τυφωθεὶς εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου.\r\n\r\nPaul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.\r\n\r\n> δεῖ δὲ καὶ μαρτυρίαν καλὴν ἔχειν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔξωθεν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ καὶ παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\r\n\r\n> Verse? What exactly contradicts this in Matthew 23?\r\n\r\nThe entire chapter. You've been fooled yet again, this time into thinking that the bible is just a collection of a bunch of contextless sentences called verses.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>I don't see how these events are examples of strong leadership?

Every one of those is a tyrant controlling everyone and squashing their opposition. In the name of glory or the \"common good\". 1 Timothy sets up the same power hierarchy and tells everyone to obey it...and in a personal letter to a friend?

And one that actually matches his writing style and doesn't use words that didn't exist until decades after his death? It's pretty obvious that it's not legit. In order to fully understand the problem, you have to be aware of what Christianity looked like in those days. It was still full of wildly different beliefs, and the orthodoxy was just beginning to form and sought centralized control and an organized church for the first time. 1 Timothy is an early attempt to discredit ideas the church considered heresy (some of them rightfully but that's no excuse to defraud), and give the church leaders more power. 1 Timothy very specifically attacks schools of thought which did not surface until after Paul's death, specifically those which relied heavily on his authentic letters, and directly contradicts Paul and early Christianity many times.

How does that begin to follow?\r\n\r\nJesus says turn the other cheek and call no one on earth teacher or father or leader. A \"strong leader\" while desireable by our primal senses is dangerous and idolatrous.\r\n\r\n> It would be inaccurate to just call Timothy \"a friend.\" Timothy was a disciple, the son of a Jewish woman and Greek man, met by Paul in Acts, whom he references in Timothy. Timothy was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium, and was specifically said to be taken with Paul as Acts continues, leading to a couple of undesigned coincidences.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's a public matter being set in a private letter and if he'd actually written it, he'd have no idea that it would survive beyond his and/or Timothy's lifetime nor be seen by many others. It doesn't make sense. Yet the writer seems to be indirectly addressing the public while framing it as a letter to an individual person.\r\n\r\n> Should Paul have attempted to make an announcement rather than instruct a letter to his diciple? That would depend on if it would have been more efficient to his time, and publicised. Obviously, we know it was successful on both fronts.\r\n\r\nIt'd be a heck of a lot more efficient than individually writing a letter to every single church official in the world.\r\n\r\n> Neat, it would be nice to know your definite proof that he used words that didn't exist until decades after his death.\r\n\r\n> No, adding to the Word of God wasn't exactly praised.\r\n\r\nThey didn't see it that way, they rationalized it as \"explaining something\" or \"using X's name to say what we think they would've said\". Also Paul's letters are the word of Paul, not the word of God, so they gave themselves more leniency.\r\n\r\n> Great, what are those schools of thought that he couldn't have known about, and what are those contradictions.\r\n\r\nProtestantism, Marcionism, and gnosticism mostly.\r\n\r\n> \"Copyists\" isn't synonymous with \"scribe.\" These were interpreters and, in their interpretations, essentially false teachers, a common idea in the bible.\r\n\r\n\"Scribe\" in the bible can also refer to copyists. Jeremiah 8:8 specifically talks about the law of God. After God denies in the very previous chapter that he ever gave certain commandments which are present in our copies of the torah.\r\n\r\n> ...Yeah?\r\n\r\nModern Christianity frowns upon anything other than finding a trad relationship, marrying, buying a 2.5 suburban home, and popping out kiddies. Most people therefore assume this is what's in the Bible.\r\n\r\n> Also concealed or deliberately mistranslated in Leviticus, Genesis, Hebrews...?\r\n\r\nThose are what God was calling out in Jeremiah. The reason those books say to sacrifice is because the lying scribes of Jeremiah 7-8 put it there.\r\n\r\n> Huh? Deuteronomy 17:14-15 Even without the context of Deuteronomy, this is read as a very situational passage. Going into a passage, especially a situational one, with the intent to prove a point rather than find the original idea of the passage isn't going to be helpful.\r\n\r\nCould very well be another redaction. But this isn't even necessary, as Deuteronomy 17:14-17 reads like a prophecy of what will occur in 1 Samuel 8, and sets laws to make sure there are still *some* checks and balances on the king's power.\r\n\r\n> It's ironic. Though I'm accussed of only listening to my favorite televangelists, you made a claim from biblical critics and simply wrote \"are judged\" as though it's the consensus of biblical scholars.\r\n\r\nThey do not match the style of the rest of the text, do not seem to be known anywhere else in the entire new testament, conflict massively with each other, and Luke 3 is a perfectly natural beginning of the gospel.\r\n\r\n> That just sounds like a stretch. Where did he declare the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot?\r\n\r\nIt's literally half the gospels. What goes into your mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it. The son is the master of the sabbath. Jesus eats with Samaritans. Jesus preaches to goyim. It's all over the place.\r\n\r\n> Considering various teachings of Jesus being new, why would teachings upon an almost completely new church be such an outrageous idea?\r\n\r\nBecause there's nothing attributed to Jesus to even suggest this being the case, and much to the contrary based on evidence from early Christians, including Paul himself.\r\n\r\n> This is further mentioned in 1 Timothy 5:14-15: So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. For some have already strayed after Satan.\r\n\r\nAgain contradicting 1 Corinthians 7. And regardless of Paul's real opinion Jesus also promotes remaining unmarried.\r\n\r\nYou conveniently skipped the part that says childbearing is a requirement for salvation, 2:15:\r\n\r\n> σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης.\r\n\r\n> But she **will be saved through the bearing of children**, if they remain in faith, love and purity with self-control.\r\n\r\nAnd not only that, but your salvation also rests on the choices on your children! If you have bad kids, you're damned too regardless of your choices! Kim Jong Un would love this.\r\n\r\n> Again, being accused of not reading the bible... though the idea that Paul wanted to keep church leaders from sexual immorality isn't even taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nHe himself was an unmarried church leader. Are you trying to tell me Paul condemns himself in his own letter for doing exactly what he's doing by sending the letter? Oh, and not only himself, but JESUS too! Combined with the emphasis on church officials being male, it's pretty obviously an attempt to fuse Roman pater-familias culture with church doctrine. Familial relations and maximizing procreation and breeding were abolished by the early Christians but extremely central to Greco-Roman culture.\r\n\r\n> ...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?\r\n\r\nIf he doesn't then why has he not resigned?\r\n\r\n> Considering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.\r\n\r\nOutsiders will always claim a good person is evil. Jesus did have a lot of followers but the masses hated his guts, and he said the same would happen to anyone who chooses to follow him. So being highly thought of by outsiders is not exactly the best measurement of how good someone is.\r\n\r\n> While taking this section out of context, I wonder if \"call no man your father/instructor was taken literally as well... When we look at this scripture without a bias, and entirely in context, we find that these were all titles used to exalt instructors, and have a final consensus that we we should not exalt ourselves as the Pharisees were.\r\n\r\nExactly, so no one should exalt themselves by taking those very same roles in 1 Timothy. Real Paul does this some but he's also very full of himself as evident in all his letters; he never advocates it.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>That makes the biblically-strong-leader = tyrant?

And regardless of Paul's real opinion Jesus also promotes remaining unmarried.</p>\n<p>You conveniently skipped the part that says childbearing is a requirement for salvation, 2:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας, ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But she <strong>will be saved through the bearing of children</strong>, if they remain in faith, love and purity with self-control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And not only that, but your salvation also rests on the choices on your children! If you have bad kids, you're damned too regardless of your choices! Kim Jong Un would love this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, being accused of not reading the bible... though the idea that Paul wanted to keep church leaders from sexual immorality isn't even taken into consideration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He himself was an unmarried church leader. Are you trying to tell me Paul condemns himself in his own letter for doing exactly what he's doing by sending the letter? Oh, and not only himself, but JESUS too! Combined with the emphasis on church officials being male, it's pretty obviously an attempt to fuse Roman pater-familias culture with church doctrine. Familial relations and maximizing procreation and breeding were abolished by the early Christians but extremely central to Greco-Roman culture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If he doesn't then why has he not resigned?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Considering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Outsiders will always claim a good person is evil. Jesus did have a lot of followers but the masses hated his guts, and he said the same would happen to anyone who chooses to follow him. So being highly thought of by outsiders is not exactly the best measurement of how good someone is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While taking this section out of context, I wonder if \"call no man your father/instructor was taken literally as well... When we look at this scripture without a bias, and entirely in context, we find that these were all titles used to exalt instructors, and have a final consensus that we we should not exalt ourselves as the Pharisees were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Exactly, so no one should exalt themselves by taking those very same roles in 1 Timothy. Real Paul does this some but he's also very full of himself as evident in all his letters; he never advocates it.</p>\n","created_utc":1623786756,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_10vd4","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1583035818,"description":"\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Every one of those is a tyrant controlling everyone and squashing their opposition.\n\nThat makes the biblically-strong-leader = tyrant? How does that begin to follow?\n\n> and in a personal letter to a friend?\n\nIt would be inaccurate to just call Timothy \"a friend.\" Timothy was a disciple, the son of a Jewish woman and Greek man, met by Paul in Acts, whom he references in Timothy. Timothy was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium, and was specifically said to be taken with Paul as Acts continues, leading to a couple of undesigned coincidences. \n\n> Wouldn't it make like a LOT more sense to do that in a public letter? \n\nShould Paul have attempted to make an announcement rather than instruct a letter to his diciple? That would depend on if it would have been more efficient to his time, and publicised. Obviously, we know it was successful on both fronts.\n\n> And one that actually matches his writing style and doesn't use words that didn't exist until decades after his death? It's pretty obvious that it's not legit.\n\nNeat, it would be nice to know your definite proof that he used words that didn't exist until decades after his death.\n\n> Also consider that in ancient times, it wasn't considered forgery to write in someone's name if it was deemed \"good\", and combined with the lack of information in those days it was quite easy to get away with it.\n\nNo, adding to the Word of God wasn't exactly praised.\n\n> 1 Timothy very specifically attacks schools of thought which did not surface until after Paul's death, specifically those which relied heavily on his authentic letters, and directly contradicts Paul and early Christianity many times.\n\nGreat, what are those schools of thought that he couldn't have known about, and what are those contradictions.\n\n> Most of what people think the bible says is actually what their favorite televangelist told them it says. For example I bet you didn't know that:\n\n> christian agrees with popular biblical interpretation, therefore hasn't read bible\n\n> The bible says it's been corrupted by scribes (Jeremiah 8:8)\n\n\"Copyists\" isn't synonymous with \"scribe.\" These were interpreters and, in their interpretations, essentially false teachers, a common idea in the bible.\n\n> Jesus is perfectly okay with not marrying and even castrating yourself (Matthew 19:12)\n\n...Yeah?\n\n> God never actually commanded sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:21-23 which is deliberately mistranslated in most english bibles to conceal this)\n\nAlso concealed or deliberately mistranslated in Leviticus, Genesis, Hebrews...?\n\n> Israel and Judah were never supposed to have a king (1 Samuel 8)\n\nHuh? \nDeuteronomy 17:14-15\nEven without the context of Deuteronomy, this is read as a very situational passage. Going into a passage, especially a situational one, with the intent to prove a point rather than find the original idea of the passage isn't going to be helpful.\n\n>Joseph is the biological father of Jesus. All the old testament prophecies clearly describe the messiah as the seed of Abraham and David, and it is not Mary who is descended from them because all the genealogies show Joseph's family tree. Luke 1-2 and Matthew 1:18-24 are judged to be later additions to the original text.\n\nIt's ironic. Though I'm accussed of only listening to my favorite televangelists, you made a claim from biblical critics and simply wrote \"are judged\" as though it's the consensus of biblical scholars. \n\n> The \"Old Testament\" is still in effect, as God never changes. Jesus did not change it, rather he declared that the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot, before the resurrection when the old law was supposedly annulled. They had changed it and twisted it. For example we can eat literal pork not because of the \"New Testament\" but because what goes into a mouth does not make someone unclean, but what comes out of it, and that has always been and always will be. All the law is derived from the golden rule which governs us, and if something doesn't it's either being misunderstood or it was altered by humans. Our idea of dispensationalism seems to stem from a misunderstanding on Paul's part in his letter to the Galatians, if that is what he truly wrote.\n\nThat just sounds like a stretch. Where did he declare the Jews had it wrong the entire time and called them out on the spot?\n\n> Literally the first one is \"don't be female\". This is hardly so important unless we understand that second-century heresies became associated with women at some point. Prior to that no such teaching existed at all, let alone so vital\n\nConsidering various teachings of Jesus being new, why would teachings upon an almost completely new church be such an outrageous idea?\n\n> Let's also be clear that the next statement literally says people who don't have children can't be saved.\n\nYes, \"literally\" in the sense of removing context to prove a point.\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Directly prior to the verse: For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.\n\n2. This is further mentioned in 1 Timothy 5:14-15: So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. For some have already strayed after Satan.\n\n3. In 1 Timothy 4:16: Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save (sozo) both yourself and your hearers. When in the context of it's own book, it certaintly does give more of a case to spiritual preservation rather than the \"not saving by faith\" idea, the idea that contradicts the church in the forgery \"decades after his death.\"\n\n> This criterion is basic \"be a good person\" stuff. Pretty much no one will disagree with that so there's not much to discuss here.\n\nIt's almost as though it's to prevent the corruption of those who teach what they do not do, otherwise the teachers of the law in Jesus' time.\n\n> The next qualification is that you must be married with children, and also that you must rule your family members. Again, this paints not doing so in a negative light, the opposite of Paul's view for at least the former point, but very much in line with Roman culture. If we are to follow this rule then we must forsake Jesus, because he did not have a spouse or children. And also Paul himself, of which the same is true, and in that case he is ironically not qualified to be setting this rule in the first place!\n\nLet's actually read what Paul said about marriage:\n\nNow concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\n\nTo the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.\n\nAgain, being accused of not reading the bible... though the idea that Paul wanted to keep church leaders from sexual immorality isn't even taken into consideration.\n\n> Paul became an apostle right after converting from brutally murdering Christians. This hardly sounds like something he'd say.\n\n...Do you think Paul wanted prior Christian-murders to be leaders of churches, and assumed they would be as godly as he is?\n\n> This is one of the most concerning ones. The gist of it is \"you must be doing what the world likes\". This contradicts the countless promises that you will instead be hated and persecuted.\n\nConsidering basically every verse prior in this chapter, the consensus is that Paul speaks that they should be men seen with a noble and godly character even by outsiders, as a man who is not known as a devout Christian to those around him (at this time) has a much higher chance of weakness in the faith, therefore weakness towards corruption.\n\n> Finally, we have the fact that we are specifically warned not to consider anyone on earth teacher or father, which was probably a statement directed at the Jewish orthodoxy, to which 1 Timothy promotes a similar system.\n\nEntire context and verse:\n\nThen Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\nWhile taking this section out of context, I wonder if \"call no man your father/instructor was taken literally as well...\nWhen we look at this scripture without a bias, and entirely in context, we find that these were all titles used to exalt instructors, and have a final consensus that we we should not exalt ourselves as the Pharisees were.\n\n> The entire chapter. You've been fooled yet again, this time into thinking that the bible is just a collection of a bunch of contextless sentences called verses. \n\nBelieve it or not, I understand the meaning of context.
