That's why they believed her.\n\nThe second of three infants to speak was a Christian infant living in Yemen 200-300 AD when the king burned the Christians alive in a ditch. A woman was hesitant to jump into the fire, and the newborn infant she was carrying said \"O Mother, you are on the true path!\" and she refused to give up the worship of God and jumped.\n\nIf you don't know the Muslim doctrine, we do believe that God ascended Jesus to Him, and that Jesus will return near the last day to slay the one-eyed antichrist called \"Al Dajjal\", \"thee liar/deciever\", who will claim to be Jesus and then your God on Earth.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Al Messih is just as \"divine\" of a name as Bar Abbas</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a political title that describes mockingly that he was claiming to be King.

My blood brother please consider this...</p>\n<p>An illiterate orphaned Arab shepherd living a few hundred years after Jesus uttered the following, saying adamantly that it is the revelation of Elloh/Allah/God:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا ٱلْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُوا۟ فِيهِ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ ۚ مَا لَهُم بِهِۦ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا ٱتِّبَاعَ ٱلظَّنِّ ۚ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًۢا</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope you will consider this.</p>\n<p>The Quran offers a beautiful story explaining how the villagers were convinced that Mary was chaste despite carrying Jesus home. It is because Jesus spoke aloud to his mother's accusors as a newborn infant as a decisive miracle from God. When the atheists and disbelievers mock Christians on this point in the media and on TV (implying adultery and insulting Mary), the Muslim would point out to them that an infant spoke to them aloud. That's why they believed her.</p>\n<p>The second of three infants to speak was a Christian infant living in Yemen 200-300 AD when the king burned the Christians alive in a ditch. A woman was hesitant to jump into the fire, and the newborn infant she was carrying said \"O Mother, you are on the true path!\" and she refused to give up the worship of God and jumped.</p>\n<p>If you don't know the Muslim doctrine, we do believe that God ascended Jesus to Him, and that Jesus will return near the last day to slay the one-eyed antichrist called \"Al Dajjal\", \"thee liar/deciever\", who will claim to be Jesus and then your God on Earth.</p>\n","created_utc":1623814097,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1623815096,"fullname":"t3_10wbg","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"10wbg","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":7,"parent_comment_id":["10w89"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/c2io/people-who-hate-christians-have-made/10wbg","post_id":"c2io","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["10wbg"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/c2io/people-who-hate-christians-have-made/10wcb","post":{"author_name":"pepeshadilay","award_count":0,"body":"Wasteland 3 is a post-apocalyptic game set in Colorado.

People like to call themselves Christian in the Godless West. It is understandable, but God will not accept anything except for Islamic (submitting) monotheism as a religion, assuming He has graced you with an opportunity to learn about it. Of course He won't hold someone culpable who never learned or had the sincere opportunity to decline with knowledge of what he was declining.</p>\n","created_utc":1623812150,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":1623813025,"fullname":"t3_10w8o","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"10w8o","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":5,"parent_comment_id":["10vvg"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/c2io/people-who-hate-christians-have-made/10w8o","post_id":"c2io","score":1,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["10w8o"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/c2io/people-who-hate-christians-have-made/10wlr","post":{"author_name":"pepeshadilay","award_count":0,"body":"Wasteland 3 is a post-apocalyptic game set in Colorado.

This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
