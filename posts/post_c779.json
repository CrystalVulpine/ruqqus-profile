In western countries, it is primarily private institutions that regulate speech. Often this is done through deplatforming, mobbing, and career destruction. Sometimes the government will also subvert dissident movements by infiltrating key organizations and astroturfing the discussion in a particular direction.

As usual, the commentary was all mindless ridicule and condemnation of the DPRK.</p>\n<p>Now, why is there a food shortage in Korea? Well it's because any nation that is 'juche,' that has to rely upon its own resources is going to experience an unsteady supply of animal products and agriculture. Sometimes there is a drought. Sometimes locusts. That's how it is.</p>\n<p>So, the westerners laugh at the Koreans, and they call Kim an evil leader, and yet their governments are the ones who actively refuse to have any kind of trade relations. Yes, the same people who will use this as some kind of gotcha literally are responsible for the families that must now endure rationing.</p>\n<p>Now, why do they do this to them? Well it's because they're not liberal and they're socialists. Westerners have this really arrogant belief that anything outside of liberal egalitarianism and a free market is dumb, inferior, and essentially evil. That, we have to endlessly bomb the Middle East because they practice a conservative theocracy.
