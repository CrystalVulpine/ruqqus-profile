Your using the definitions where sex refers to biology and gender to cultural roles correct?\n\nThe issue I'm seeing is most people grow up equating the two to mean biological sex and don't see a reason to stop now. Even tomboys are still referred to as women because they are biologically female even if they act more masculine. I'm one of these people, but I have a reason beyond \"degeneracy\".\n\nI think it would make more sense if all these different \"genders\" are called personalities, because that's what genders, by the definition your going by, basically are. A person isn't \"boyflux\" for example: they're a dude that doesn't always act stereotypically like a dude.
