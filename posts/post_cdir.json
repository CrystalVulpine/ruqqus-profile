There's all kinds of shit going on in the background with anime shows and unfortunately the problems rear their head in the final product quite a bit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-epvGKqFKDM\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-epvGKqFKDM</a></p>\n<p>Just found this so you can show how much the anime creators abuse the 3D sometimes to fit the schedule, it seems they only did the characters in 2D and then all the backgrounds 3D. Other people might not notice that much, but for me it's really jarring and I often give up on watching shows that use this method too much even if it's got a really good story, they've got to blend it in right for it to work. Other times you have mechs and so on that get turned 3D and the animation looks almost unfinished because of how the movement looks, too jerks and missing frames etc. which is why I believe it's more of a timeframe thing possibly.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1625076072, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1625076369, "fullname": "t3_11wsc", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1581786138, "description": "Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Posts must be questions.

Then there's some fun spins on the concept like The Devil Is A Part-Timer (Demon Lord from another world ends up in 'our' world, becomes powerless and takes a job at MgRonald's to make ends meet, while his rival ends up in the same situation and has to take up a job at a telecom support call center). \n\nIf you're looking to just have some fun, shut your brain off adventure comedies any of the Lupin the 3rd series or movies are great picks.

The best one however I've found is a rather strange one called Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai as it uses some sci-fi traits to alter reality for the sake of story telling. I will say however the last story arc of the series and the follow-up OVA movie will hit you like a truck...have tissues on stand-by. \n\nIf you're looking for a Victorian era occult mystery the first season of Black Butler and it's 4 OVA's are definitely worth checking out...Season 2 is one of those love it or hate kind of deals.", "body_html": "<p>It also depends on what kind of stories you like.

There's a reason why people such as SMG4 gained 10x the audience by drastically decreasing their quality to give more screen time to girls who are obviously designed to appeal to horny males. That's what anime does too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Used to avidly watch SMG4 because it was at one point a really funny evolution of YouTube Poop. I knew something was off with his more recent content but I couldn't put my finger on it until you just pointed it out.</p>\n<p>SMG4 has been giving a lot more screen time to his more sexualised OCs who simply don't fit the universe of video game parodies, namely Tari and Meggy. In the case of Meggy it's particularly concerning because she's an inkling, and inklings from the Splatoon universe are made to look like mid-teen girls...</p>\n<p>In my view that was the point where his channel declined, not when he scrapped the Retarded64 series in order to become more \"advertiser friendly.\"</p>\n", "created_utc": 1625261367, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1625261534, "fullname": "t3_122fe", "guild_id": "1v", "herald_guild": null, "id": "122fe", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 2, "parent_comment_id": ["11x1g"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/cdir/why-is-everyone-obsessed-with-anime/122fe", "post_id": "cdir", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["122fe"], "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/cdir/why-is-everyone-obsessed-with-anime/122sj", "post": {"author_name": null, "award_count": 1, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 123, "created_utc": 1625065257, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_cdir", "guild_id": "1v", "guild_name": "AskRuqqus", "herald_guild": null, "id": "cdir", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+AskRuqqus/post/cdir/why-is-everyone-obsessed-with-anime", "score": 48, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Why is everyone obsessed with anime these days?", "upvotes": 49, "url": ""}, "post_id": "cdir", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
