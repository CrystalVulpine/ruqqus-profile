A lot of women get pissed when you bring up hormones. But shifts in hormones absolutely can and do affect one\u2019s mood.</p>\n<p>Women experience a lot of hormone changes throughout their 28-day cycle (for some it\u2019s more, for some it\u2019s less, for others it\u2019s irregular). These changes can have an effect on a woman\u2019s mood, energy levels, and libido.</p>\n<p>We like to think that women get bitchy on their periods.
