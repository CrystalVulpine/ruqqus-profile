{"author":{"ban_reason":"","id":"1rof","is_banned":true,"is_permanent_ban":true,"permalink":"/@Lethn","username":"Lethn"},"author_name":"Lethn","award_count":0,"body":"Trump was just a catalyst for what was already there, it had been brewing for ages, people just like to pin the blame on Trump because he's good at provoking them and they take the bait every time. This isn't me writing this either for or against him it's just a fact. I also happen to be somebody who in the UK at least has lived in one of the most left wing areas in the country for 31 years and this mentality was always there. I think the real reason Trump caused the political split it just exposed all of these frauds for who they were, the 'tolerance' mask slipped because the only thing was keeping it together was that people simply refused to talk about issues that made them uncomfortable. \n\nThat I believe is the deeper reason for the split, as a result it's a shock to the leftists that anyone would dare think differently from them and they feel personally hurt and attacked that any of their friends and family would go against them on anything. The sheer fucking arrogance of that kind of attitude, I bring this up because for us it was Brexit, this was all before Trump and I voted leave in the EU referendum the left just couldn't fathom how anyone could disagree with them on anything and they lashed out as a result.

Sodomy was \"illegal\" in <em>parts</em> of the US but that was probably taken about as seriously as the law against singing in the bathtub. Also that wouldn't be a conservative position because it promotes strong government control and lack of individual autonomy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gays are massively over represented among child molesters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is true and it makes sense that someone who is abnormal in one way will also be in another way. But you're painting it as if they're ALL pedos <em>and</em> can't control themselves enough to not molest kids.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trannies are largely groomers and are hugely interested in inducting more people into their cult.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Them wanting to force business owners to let them into the women' bathroom is just as bad. But there are two types, and if it weren't for the SJWs screaming about \"bigots\" nonstop no one would support this kind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LGBT as a whole has a huge grooming problem with how they want their propaganda in regular programming (example: the drag queen that got onto Nick Jr and Blues Clues).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those are more SJWs and CEOs trying to make money by acting trendy than groomers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And when they're not doing that, they're being insufferable in other ways like begging to be 'hit' so they can claim persecution and wild more power, like in the infamous baker cake and ball waxing cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The screeching libtards who probably aren't even for real and just want attention yeah.

If we manage to affect our Sun in such a way that would slow down its fusion cycle, we can make it last longer than it would on its own, meaning we had a significant negative-entropy effect on it. While such an endeavour may sound impossibly hard to engineer, if you look at the graph of our energy consumption (and production) as a civilization, if all goes well, we'll get there soon enough. And the further we manage to preserve ourselves, the more is the chance we will preserve our habitats too, maybe even including our Universe, and that may be our ultimate goal. Accumulating knowledge also seems like a by-product of our life. Who knows, maybe it is our actual objective - to find answers to questions we might not even know exist yet.</p>\n","created_utc":1625482308,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_127wo","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#7B9AE4","created_utc":1582833064,"description":"Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?

Take, for example our solar system. If we manage to affect our Sun in such a way that would slow down its fusion cycle, we can make it last longer than it would on its own, meaning we had a significant negative-entropy effect on it. While such an endeavour may sound impossibly hard to engineer, if you look at the graph of our energy consumption (and production) as a civilization, if all goes well, we'll get there soon enough. And the further we manage to preserve ourselves, the more is the chance we will preserve our habitats too, maybe even including our Universe, and that may be our ultimate goal. Accumulating knowledge also seems like a by-product of our life.

Take, for example our solar system. If we manage to affect our Sun in such a way that would slow down its fusion cycle, we can make it last longer than it would on its own, meaning we had a significant negative-entropy effect on it. While such an endeavour may sound impossibly hard to engineer, if you look at the graph of our energy consumption (and production) as a civilization, if all goes well, we'll get there soon enough.
