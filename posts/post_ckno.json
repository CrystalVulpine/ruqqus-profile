I know posting an unpopular idea on a sub for unpopular ideas is a radical idea and all. I like Ruqqus. I really do and I want it to succeed, but there is way too much racism on this site. I feel gross just seeing a post with people saying racist things. Look, I'm not perfect and I think satire is funny sometimes, but I know for a fact a lot of shit on here is not satire. You can call me whatever names you want, I don't care. I am a conservative guy and I'm on here because I hate big tech and MSM, not because I want to see racists posting nasty things all the time. Being a Conservative is not about being a racist - I believe all people are equal. I know this is a free speech site and I understand that being free speech is going to open up to site to stuff like that and I'm not saying Ruqqus needs to change their policies, but damn does this site sometimes disappoint me. I just wish for once we could see a conservative/censorship-free site succeed and people like that are the ones who always cause the downfall.</p>\n<p><em>NAMECALLING INBOUND</em></p>\n","comment_count":93,"created_utc":1625865046,"domain":"text post","downvotes":11,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t2_ckno","guild_id":"35","guild_name":"UnpopularOpinion","herald_guild":null,"id":"ckno","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_crosspost":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"is_pinned":false,"meta_description":"","meta_title":"","original_guild_id":null,"original_guild_name":null,"permalink":"/+UnpopularOpinion/post/ckno/how-about-an-opinion-thats-actually","score":46,"thumb_url":null,"title":"How about an opinion that's actually going to be unpopular?
