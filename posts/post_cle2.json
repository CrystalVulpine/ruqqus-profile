Testosterone pretty much puts a cork on the emotional bottle, so you literally *can't* feel anything, but you still desperately need to. And trust me it's a lot worse than you think to go through life completely boring and monotonous. Except you're also constantly on edge and angry. You lose all your creativity and natural abilities.

You've obviously never experienced testosterone before. Females are more androgynous and have more biological functions. Males are solely for sex, fighting, and working.

You are too overworked about the stereotype of emotional irrational damsel, which is encouraged more by society than hormones. Testosterone pretty much puts a cork on the emotional bottle, so you literally <em>can't</em> feel anything, but you still desperately need to. And trust me it's a lot worse than you think to go through life completely boring and monotonous. Except you're also constantly on edge and angry. You lose all your creativity and natural abilities. And imagine even the best thing that could ever happen to you resulting only a dilluted, barely existant form of happiness, joy, fun, love, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is made to enable and enhance the inhabitant’s agency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nope, males are the expendable ones.
