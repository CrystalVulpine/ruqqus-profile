Women today (feminists) can say whatever they like but the alpha romance genre is booming. Independent authors writing \"love\" (mostly sex) stories about alpha males (shifter, vampire, alien) mating with women is a Huge genre making tons of money by self-published authors on amazon. In fact, the genre is outpacing, pound for pound, any other current offerings. That's why there's a NYT best selling list...and a USA best selling list. And every one of the novels on top on the USA? Alpha males mating with/dominating women. Their main characteristics: Big, strong, powerful, CONFIDENT men who fall madly in love with ONE woman and become big, powerful, confident Protectors who would Never, Ever cheat on their mate. Who would protect them to the death, defend them against even the slightest hint of threat. Who would never even look at another woman (in the books, some mystical or alien or preternatural force that renders them forever in love, and forever faithful). That's it. That's what women really want in their deepest heart. Feminists can say whatever they want--they can spout bullshit rhetoric...but biology does not change. Women want Warriors who are mad for them--and ONLY them--who will protect, shelter and nurture them and protect them.</p>\n<p>If you think I'm wrong, look at the sales. That's what women are buying. They might settle for a less than optimal \"beta\" man, or a cheater, or someone who will give them kids until they can support themselves and dump him because he cheated--or can't change the oil in her car to save his own life--but what they dream about? That's a whole different story.</p>\n<p>You want to catch a woman? Read those romances and mirror those men.</p>\n<p>Why? Biology and survival of the fittest.

Every time I get my hopes up and start looking, I start seeing more and more things I don't like. Friends getting divorced, other friends being cheated on, outrageous wedding demands from other friends...hell, I was propositioned by an old classmate that I dated way back in high school, which normally would be a good thing but hear me out. She was married. I politely turned her down. Recently, her husband had passed, and what did she do? Contact me again. I explained to her in no uncertain terms that if she was willing to cheat on her husband with me, it would only be a matter of time before she cheated on me, just like she did when we dated back in high school. I couldn't trust her. \n\nI came close to being married once. I never loved a woman like I loved her. Even though it seemed like everything I did wasn't good enough, I did everything in my power to keep her happy. Once the newness wore off was when things started getting sour. Arguments all the time over dumb shit, where she would be name calling while I tried to explain my position and why I felt the way I did. She'd spend hours constantly on the phone with \"friends\". I'd come home, she'd be on the phone, I'd make dinner, she'd get off the phone to eat, and 15 minutes after dinner, she'd text, and then call her friend. Long story short, she was cheating. When I found out was when we broke it off. Thank God we didn't start the wedding plans yet. I was lucky enough to get the ring back. \n\nLast one I was in a relationship with was over a year ago. Everything was cool for a while, but she made sure that every weekend she was visiting her sister and niece. Needless to say she wasn't visiting her sister and niece. I found she was sexting and sending nudes to some random dude, making plans to go fuck him on those days she was supposed to be with her sister. \n\nSo don't get me wrong, I'd love to find a more traditional woman who I would be attracted to and be able to trust. But I'm getting up there in age, and it seems that women everywhere are moving further and further away from traditionalism and want you to forget about their past (knowing their past will tell you what kind of decision maker they are). So I've been concentrating more on myself, doing things that make me happy. Part of the problem I guess is that I live in a big city, in a liberal state, so that mindset permeates through most of the women I've met.","body_html":"<p>I've gotten to the point in my life where I don't need a nuclear family to be happy.

They have forgotten their biological imperative. They have rejected what they ARE on a fundamental, biological level. And until we get back to that biological imperative and admit we are really nothing more than animals being moved by instincts greater and more powerful than our own \"intellect\" we will never truly know fulfillment.</p>\n","created_utc":1625985227,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_12mam","guild_id":"1v","herald_guild":null,"id":"12mam","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/cll5/what-are-your-strongest-arguments-for/12mam","post_id":"cll5","score":7,"upvotes":8,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["12mam"],"permalink":"/+AskRuqqus/post/cll5/what-are-your-strongest-arguments-for/12n0i","post":{"author_name":"PizzaW0lf","award_count":0,"body":"I'll keep it short but my case would be that without strong masculine men, we would've lost the world wars and such.
