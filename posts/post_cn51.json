They are very often absolute pricks, control freaks and genuinely greedy in a bad way.</p>\n<p>I used to fantasize about a big house, expensive watches and a 6 figure salary. Cant say I achieved all of this before snapping (thank god), but a Rolex did nothing. Chasing money, social status and materialism is a scam. Being self reliant, independent and not having to care about other people is better, and hanging out with rich people is not often very rewarding. They're often dicks.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the rant, but in short no. I absolutely do not envy their wealth, many of them are infinitely more reliant on the \"system\" and are ironically less free than me. Among the wealthiest are mostly just corrupt pieces of shit, dishonest manipulators, talentless heirs/nepotists who did nothing to deserve it, and of course the commies could come for them and I wouldnt move, but the real entrepreneurs who at least deserve their money are often huge dicks who I have not much empathy for either. Very few from the top of my head make exceptions like Peter Thiel, Roger Ver and that Chamitsmth guy from Sri Lanka</p>\n<p>/schizo rant over</p>\n","created_utc":1626188127,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_12rhu","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1581786138,"description":"Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n🤔 Posts must be questions.
