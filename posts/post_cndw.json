I'll try to be as brief as possible.\n\nFirst and foremost, Christianity doesn't feel like a commitment to God or Christ. It feels like a commitment to The Bible. The Bible consists of 66 books, many of which have different contexts. Are we certain that Paul the Apostle meant for his letters to Churches to be taught as religious doctrine? At one point Paul even states he is saying something, not God. I believe that's the part where he talks about how it's better to marry than to burn with passion (I could be wrong). \n\nThere's also the problem of influence throughout history. Versions differ from one another. For example, many translations leave out the \"As a man thinks, so is he\" verse from Proverbs (23:7 I think?). That's not a huge deal but it does show that at least some changes occur between translations.\n\nThe Gospel accounts, at the very least, indicate that the scripture isn't completely accurate in regard to history as the accounts change between each apostle. This presents the idea that perhaps, even if it is a true account, the intent was never to follow each letter but to grasp the concept of Salvation through Christ. \n\nMy personal view on God stems from creation itself. When I look around I see a lot of purpose. Something like the desire to survive, the desire to reproduce, feeling \"good\" when we do something good, feeling guilty when we do something bad... many of these can be written off as learned behavior but we can see signs of them in infants. \n\nThe Bible almost condemns feeling good about anything other than God himself. Granted, if he did create everything then we should be grateful to him. I get that part.

I'll try to be as brief as possible.\n\nFirst and foremost, Christianity doesn't feel like a commitment to God or Christ. It feels like a commitment to The Bible. The Bible consists of 66 books, many of which have different contexts. Are we certain that Paul the Apostle meant for his letters to Churches to be taught as religious doctrine? At one point Paul even states he is saying something, not God. I believe that's the part where he talks about how it's better to marry than to burn with passion (I could be wrong). \n\nThere's also the problem of influence throughout history. Versions differ from one another. For example, many translations leave out the \"As a man thinks, so is he\" verse from Proverbs (23:7 I think?). That's not a huge deal but it does show that at least some changes occur between translations.\n\nThe Gospel accounts, at the very least, indicate that the scripture isn't completely accurate in regard to history as the accounts change between each apostle. This presents the idea that perhaps, even if it is a true account, the intent was never to follow each letter but to grasp the concept of Salvation through Christ. \n\nMy personal view on God stems from creation itself. When I look around I see a lot of purpose. Something like the desire to survive, the desire to reproduce, feeling \"good\" when we do something good, feeling guilty when we do something bad... many of these can be written off as learned behavior but we can see signs of them in infants. \n\nThe Bible almost condemns feeling good about anything other than God himself. Granted, if he did create everything then we should be grateful to him. I get that part. But the idea of creating things that feel good that we're NOT supposed to engage in seems kind of evil. \n\nUltimately, I'm a speck of dust floating around on a speck of dust and I don't know shit. I've seen a fraction of a fraction of what this reality has to offer. I could be right. I could be wrong. I could be somewhere in between. Personally the most evidence I've seen of the Bible being true is the current social situations where it's perfectly acceptable to mock Christians and in some cases, even burn Churches. That was certainly foretold.","body_html":"<p>Honestly I'm all over the place with it. I'll try to be as brief as possible.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, Christianity doesn't feel like a commitment to God or Christ. It feels like a commitment to The Bible. The Bible consists of 66 books, many of which have different contexts. Are we certain that Paul the Apostle meant for his letters to Churches to be taught as religious doctrine? At one point Paul even states he is saying something, not God. I believe that's the part where he talks about how it's better to marry than to burn with passion (I could be wrong).</p>\n<p>There's also the problem of influence throughout history. Versions differ from one another. For example, many translations leave out the \"As a man thinks, so is he\" verse from Proverbs (23:7 I think?). That's not a huge deal but it does show that at least some changes occur between translations.</p>\n<p>The Gospel accounts, at the very least, indicate that the scripture isn't completely accurate in regard to history as the accounts change between each apostle. This presents the idea that perhaps, even if it is a true account, the intent was never to follow each letter but to grasp the concept of Salvation through Christ.</p>\n<p>My personal view on God stems from creation itself. When I look around I see a lot of purpose. Something like the desire to survive, the desire to reproduce, feeling \"good\" when we do something good, feeling guilty when we do something bad... many of these can be written off as learned behavior but we can see signs of them in infants.</p>\n<p>The Bible almost condemns feeling good about anything other than God himself. Granted, if he did create everything then we should be grateful to him. I get that part. But the idea of creating things that feel good that we're NOT supposed to engage in seems kind of evil.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I'm a speck of dust floating around on a speck of dust and I don't know shit. I've seen a fraction of a fraction of what this reality has to offer. I could be right. I could be wrong. I could be somewhere in between.
