Not once does he warn against animal sacrifice simply being done.\n\nJeremiah 7:22\nFor in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them: \u2018Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.\u2019 But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day. Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.\n\nThis is entirely correct. If don\u2019t reject the timeline of Exodus, he did not speak to their fathers about the 10 commandments, nor about sacrifice. \n\nOn the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain, while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, \u201cThus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.\u201d\nSo Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered together and said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.\u201d\nWhen Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.\n\nAfter these days, God gave the 10 Commandments, and ceremonial sacrifice to atone to one\u2019s failure at keeping them. Evidently, there is no contradiction.\n\nIsaiah 1:\nHear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;\nfor the LORD has spoken:\n\u201cChildren have I reared and brought up,\nbut they have rebelled against me.\nThe ox knows its owner,\nand the donkey its master\u2019s crib,\nbut Israel does not know,\nmy people do not understand.\u201d\nAh, sinful nation,\na people laden with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\nchildren who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken the LORD,\nthey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nthey are utterly estranged.\nWhy will you still be struck down?\nWhy will you continue to rebel?\nThe whole head is sick,\nand the whole heart faint.\nFrom the sole of the foot even to the head,\nthere is no soundness in it,\nbut bruises and sores\nand raw wounds;\nthey are not pressed out or bound up\nor softened with oil.\nYour country lies desolate;\nyour cities are burned with fire;\nin your very presence\nforeigners devour your land;\nit is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.\nAnd the daughter of Zion is left\nlike a booth in a vineyard,\nlike a lodge in a cucumber field,\nlike a besieged city.\nIf the LORD of hosts\nhad not left us a few survivors,\nwe should have been like Sodom,\nand become like Gomorrah.\nHear the word of the LORD,\nyou rulers of Sodom!\nGive ear to the teaching of our God,\nyou people of Gomorrah!\n\u201cWhat to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\nsays the LORD;\nI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nand the fat of well-fed beasts;\nI do not delight in the blood of bulls,\nor of lambs, or of goats.\n\u201cWhen you come to appear before me,\nwho has required of you\nthis trampling of my courts?\nBring no more vain offerings;\nincense is an abomination to me.\nNew moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations\u2014\nI cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.\nYour new moons and your appointed feasts\nmy soul hates;\nthey have become a burden to me;\nI am weary of bearing them.\nWhen you spread out your hands,\nI will hide my eyes from you;\neven though you make many prayers,\nI will not listen;\nyour hands are full of blood.\nWash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\nremove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\nlearn to do good;\nseek justice,\ncorrect oppression;\nbring justice to the fatherless,\nplead the widow\u2019s cause.\n\nGod seems to rebuke sacrifice, the sabbath\u2026 and prayer. Naturally, it would do us well to look at the context, and it\u2019s extremely obvious that God is not condemning the praise itself, but the empty nature of the prayers. This is why God swiftly lists the reasons for the condemnation, a lack of justice and an increase in oppression, all while giving sacrifice as a mere ritual.\n\nMicah 6:\nHear what the LORD says:\nArise, plead your case before the mountains,\nand let the hills hear your voice.\nHear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD,\nand you enduring foundations of the earth,\nfor the LORD has an indictment against his people,\nand he will contend with Israel.\n\u201cO my people, what have I done to you?\nHow have I wearied you? Answer me!\nFor I brought you up from the land of Egypt\nand redeemed you from the house of slavery,\nand I sent before you Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam.\nO my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\nand what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\nthat you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.\u201d\n\u201cWith what shall I come before the LORD,\nand bow myself before God on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\nwith calves a year old?\nWill the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,\nwith ten thousands of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\nthe fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\u201d\nHe has told you, O man, what is good;\nand what does the LORD require of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\nand to walk humbly with your God?\n\nHere, the people in question lose the entire idea of sacrifice, and think its value must be equal to God\u2019s approval. However, God\u2019s approval is truly based on one\u2019s willingness to follow his commands, and sacrifice without attempted obedience, yet again, becomes an empty ritual.\n\nAs a close example to ceremonial values:\n\u201cJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.\n\nCalling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \u201cTruly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything\u2014all she had to live on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosea 6:4-6\nWhat shall I do with you, O Ephraim?\nWhat shall I do with you, O Judah?\nYour love is like a morning cloud,\nlike the dew that goes early away.\nTherefore I have hewn them by the prophets;\nI have slain them by the words of my mouth,\nand my judgment goes forth as the light.\nFor I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.\n\nYet again, we see an instance of a people ignoring God\u2019s commands, while hoping that their \u201cvalue\u201d of a sacrifice will redeem their empty faith. They replace steadfast love with one \u201clike a morning cloud,\u201d and, following the specific trend of God\u2019s condemnation of vain repetitions in sacrifice, believe it can save them.\n\nWe also have numerous verses of God commanding sacrifice. Of course, even after all the positive evidence towards Jeremiah 8:8\u2019s correct interpretation, and positive evidence against it proving untrue, we can simply avoid it by assuming that your interpretation of Jeremiah 8:8 is true and all verses not supporting your view of animal sacrifice are forgeries. It would be a roundabout way of circular reasoning, but without any other positive evidence there\u2019s not much more to do.\n\nWhere does Jesus disobey the Old Testament?\n\nWhat is your evidence for Ezra being responsible for an unnecessary redaction of the Old Testament?\n\nYes, Prophet Daniel referenced the Law given by Moses. We only see this Law referred to in an authoritative manner and no statements of the Law's untrustworthiness. \n\n\"However given that it literally contradicts the very sermon it's part of on nearly every point, let alone all the other times Jesus denounces the supposed law\"\nHow so?\n\n\"and isn't attested anywhere else except a one-liner in Luke that seems edited in and is in an entirely different spot\"\nInformation only attested in one gospel is hardly evidence of a forgery. There could be a debate if the information contradicts information in other gospels, but this isn't the case. Also, I'm not seeing anything about it in Luke.\n\nUnless we find an OT law about picking and eating grain on the Sabbath, this is Jesus calling the Teachers out on condemning due to manmade traditions(Mark 7:1-9). To get the point across, he acknowledges that David, a man they held in high regard, did not follow their tradition. Along with this, we see many references Jesus gave to the OT, though he does not once put it under the level of the authoritative Word of God.", "body_html": "<p>In every instance of God condemning animal sacrifice, without exception, his people are ignoring God\u2019s commands and utilizing sacrifice as a mere ceremonial, ritual obedience.

If don\u2019t reject the timeline of Exodus, he did not speak to their fathers about the 10 commandments, nor about sacrifice.</p>\n<p>On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain, while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, \u201cThus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.\u201d\nSo Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered together and said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.\u201d\nWhen Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.</p>\n<p>After these days, God gave the 10 Commandments, and ceremonial sacrifice to atone to one\u2019s failure at keeping them. Evidently, there is no contradiction.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 1:\nHear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;\nfor the LORD has spoken:\n\u201cChildren have I reared and brought up,\nbut they have rebelled against me.\nThe ox knows its owner,\nand the donkey its master\u2019s crib,\nbut Israel does not know,\nmy people do not understand.\u201d\nAh, sinful nation,\na people laden with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\nchildren who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken the LORD,\nthey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nthey are utterly estranged.\nWhy will you still be struck down?\nWhy will you continue to rebel?\nThe whole head is sick,\nand the whole heart faint.\nFrom the sole of the foot even to the head,\nthere is no soundness in it,\nbut bruises and sores\nand raw wounds;\nthey are not pressed out or bound up\nor softened with oil.\nYour country lies desolate;\nyour cities are burned with fire;\nin your very presence\nforeigners devour your land;\nit is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.\nAnd the daughter of Zion is left\nlike a booth in a vineyard,\nlike a lodge in a cucumber field,\nlike a besieged city.\nIf the LORD of hosts\nhad not left us a few survivors,\nwe should have been like Sodom,\nand become like Gomorrah.\nHear the word of the LORD,\nyou rulers of Sodom!\nGive ear to the teaching of our God,\nyou people of Gomorrah!\n\u201cWhat to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\nsays the LORD;\nI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nand the fat of well-fed beasts;\nI do not delight in the blood of bulls,\nor of lambs, or of goats.\n\u201cWhen you come to appear before me,\nwho has required of you\nthis trampling of my courts?\nBring no more vain offerings;\nincense is an abomination to me.\nNew moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations\u2014\nI cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.\nYour new moons and your appointed feasts\nmy soul hates;\nthey have become a burden to me;\nI am weary of bearing them.\nWhen you spread out your hands,\nI will hide my eyes from you;\neven though you make many prayers,\nI will not listen;\nyour hands are full of blood.\nWash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\nremove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\nlearn to do good;\nseek justice,\ncorrect oppression;\nbring justice to the fatherless,\nplead the widow\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p>God seems to rebuke sacrifice, the sabbath\u2026 and prayer. Naturally, it would do us well to look at the context, and it\u2019s extremely obvious that God is not condemning the praise itself, but the empty nature of the prayers. This is why God swiftly lists the reasons for the condemnation, a lack of justice and an increase in oppression, all while giving sacrifice as a mere ritual.</p>\n<p>Micah 6:\nHear what the LORD says:\nArise, plead your case before the mountains,\nand let the hills hear your voice.\nHear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD,\nand you enduring foundations of the earth,\nfor the LORD has an indictment against his people,\nand he will contend with Israel.\n\u201cO my people, what have I done to you?\nHow have I wearied you? Answer me!\nFor I brought you up from the land of Egypt\nand redeemed you from the house of slavery,\nand I sent before you Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam.\nO my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\nand what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\nthat you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.\u201d\n\u201cWith what shall I come before the LORD,\nand bow myself before God on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\nwith calves a year old?\nWill the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,\nwith ten thousands of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\nthe fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\u201d\nHe has told you, O man, what is good;\nand what does the LORD require of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\nand to walk humbly with your God?</p>\n<p>Here, the people in question lose the entire idea of sacrifice, and think its value must be equal to God\u2019s approval. However, God\u2019s approval is truly based on one\u2019s willingness to follow his commands, and sacrifice without attempted obedience, yet again, becomes an empty ritual.</p>\n<p>As a close example to ceremonial values:\n\u201cJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.</p>\n<p>Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \u201cTruly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything\u2014all she had to live on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hosea 6:4-6\nWhat shall I do with you, O Ephraim?\nWhat shall I do with you, O Judah?\nYour love is like a morning cloud,\nlike the dew that goes early away.\nTherefore I have hewn them by the prophets;\nI have slain them by the words of my mouth,\nand my judgment goes forth as the light.\nFor I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</p>\n<p>Yet again, we see an instance of a people ignoring God\u2019s commands, while hoping that their \u201cvalue\u201d of a sacrifice will redeem their empty faith. They replace steadfast love with one \u201clike a morning cloud,\u201d and, following the specific trend of God\u2019s condemnation of vain repetitions in sacrifice, believe it can save them.</p>\n<p>We also have numerous verses of God commanding sacrifice. Of course, even after all the positive evidence towards Jeremiah 8:8\u2019s correct interpretation, and positive evidence against it proving untrue, we can simply avoid it by assuming that your interpretation of Jeremiah 8:8 is true and all verses not supporting your view of animal sacrifice are forgeries. It would be a roundabout way of circular reasoning, but without any other positive evidence there\u2019s not much more to do.</p>\n<p>Where does Jesus disobey the Old Testament?</p>\n<p>What is your evidence for Ezra being responsible for an unnecessary redaction of the Old Testament?</p>\n<p>Yes, Prophet Daniel referenced the Law given by Moses. We only see this Law referred to in an authoritative manner and no statements of the Law's untrustworthiness.</p>\n<p>\"However given that it literally contradicts the very sermon it's part of on nearly every point, let alone all the other times Jesus denounces the supposed law\"\nHow so?</p>\n<p>\"and isn't attested anywhere else except a one-liner in Luke that seems edited in and is in an entirely different spot\"\nInformation only attested in one gospel is hardly evidence of a forgery. There could be a debate if the information contradicts information in other gospels, but this isn't the case. Also, I'm not seeing anything about it in Luke.</p>\n<p>Unless we find an OT law about picking and eating grain on the Sabbath, this is Jesus calling the Teachers out on condemning due to manmade traditions(Mark 7:1-9). To get the point across, he acknowledges that David, a man they held in high regard, did not follow their tradition. Along with this, we see many references Jesus gave to the OT, though he does not once put it under the level of the authoritative Word of God.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1626987328, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_13cdm", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/christianity/banner-1.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1583035818, "description": "\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Not once does he warn against animal sacrifice simply being done.\n\nJeremiah 7:22\nFor in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them: \u2018Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.\u2019 But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day. Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.\n\nThis is entirely correct. If don\u2019t reject the timeline of Exodus, he did not speak to their fathers about the 10 commandments, nor about sacrifice. \n\nOn the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain, while Moses went up to God. The Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, \u201cThus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: \u2018You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.\u201d\nSo Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered together and said, \u201cAll that the Lord has spoken we will do.\u201d And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cBehold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.\u201d\nWhen Moses told the words of the people to the Lord, the Lord said to Moses, \u201cGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.\n\nAfter these days, God gave the 10 Commandments, and ceremonial sacrifice to atone to one\u2019s failure at keeping them. Evidently, there is no contradiction.\n\nIsaiah 1:\nHear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;\nfor the LORD has spoken:\n\u201cChildren have I reared and brought up,\nbut they have rebelled against me.\nThe ox knows its owner,\nand the donkey its master\u2019s crib,\nbut Israel does not know,\nmy people do not understand.\u201d\nAh, sinful nation,\na people laden with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\nchildren who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken the LORD,\nthey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nthey are utterly estranged.\nWhy will you still be struck down?\nWhy will you continue to rebel?\nThe whole head is sick,\nand the whole heart faint.\nFrom the sole of the foot even to the head,\nthere is no soundness in it,\nbut bruises and sores\nand raw wounds;\nthey are not pressed out or bound up\nor softened with oil.\nYour country lies desolate;\nyour cities are burned with fire;\nin your very presence\nforeigners devour your land;\nit is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.\nAnd the daughter of Zion is left\nlike a booth in a vineyard,\nlike a lodge in a cucumber field,\nlike a besieged city.\nIf the LORD of hosts\nhad not left us a few survivors,\nwe should have been like Sodom,\nand become like Gomorrah.\nHear the word of the LORD,\nyou rulers of Sodom!\nGive ear to the teaching of our God,\nyou people of Gomorrah!\n\u201cWhat to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\nsays the LORD;\nI have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nand the fat of well-fed beasts;\nI do not delight in the blood of bulls,\nor of lambs, or of goats.\n\u201cWhen you come to appear before me,\nwho has required of you\nthis trampling of my courts?\nBring no more vain offerings;\nincense is an abomination to me.\nNew moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations\u2014\nI cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.\nYour new moons and your appointed feasts\nmy soul hates;\nthey have become a burden to me;\nI am weary of bearing them.\nWhen you spread out your hands,\nI will hide my eyes from you;\neven though you make many prayers,\nI will not listen;\nyour hands are full of blood.\nWash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\nremove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\nlearn to do good;\nseek justice,\ncorrect oppression;\nbring justice to the fatherless,\nplead the widow\u2019s cause.\n\nGod seems to rebuke sacrifice, the sabbath\u2026 and prayer. Naturally, it would do us well to look at the context, and it\u2019s extremely obvious that God is not condemning the praise itself, but the empty nature of the prayers. This is why God swiftly lists the reasons for the condemnation, a lack of justice and an increase in oppression, all while giving sacrifice as a mere ritual.\n\nMicah 6:\nHear what the LORD says:\nArise, plead your case before the mountains,\nand let the hills hear your voice.\nHear, you mountains, the indictment of the LORD,\nand you enduring foundations of the earth,\nfor the LORD has an indictment against his people,\nand he will contend with Israel.\n\u201cO my people, what have I done to you?\nHow have I wearied you? Answer me!\nFor I brought you up from the land of Egypt\nand redeemed you from the house of slavery,\nand I sent before you Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam.\nO my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\nand what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\nthat you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.\u201d\n\u201cWith what shall I come before the LORD,\nand bow myself before God on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\nwith calves a year old?\nWill the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,\nwith ten thousands of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\nthe fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\u201d\nHe has told you, O man, what is good;\nand what does the LORD require of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\nand to walk humbly with your God?\n\nHere, the people in question lose the entire idea of sacrifice, and think its value must be equal to God\u2019s approval. However, God\u2019s approval is truly based on one\u2019s willingness to follow his commands, and sacrifice without attempted obedience, yet again, becomes an empty ritual.\n\nAs a close example to ceremonial values:\n\u201cJesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.\n\nCalling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \u201cTruly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything\u2014all she had to live on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosea 6:4-6\nWhat shall I do with you, O Ephraim?\nWhat shall I do with you, O Judah?\nYour love is like a morning cloud,\nlike the dew that goes early away.\nTherefore I have hewn them by the prophets;\nI have slain them by the words of my mouth,\nand my judgment goes forth as the light.\nFor I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,\nthe knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.\n\nYet again, we see an instance of a people ignoring God\u2019s commands, while hoping that their \u201cvalue\u201d of a sacrifice will redeem their empty faith. They replace steadfast love with one \u201clike a morning cloud,\u201d and, following the specific trend of God\u2019s condemnation of vain repetitions in sacrifice, believe it can save them.\n\nWe also have numerous verses of God commanding sacrifice. Of course, even after all the positive evidence towards Jeremiah 8:8\u2019s correct interpretation, and positive evidence against it proving untrue, we can simply avoid it by assuming that your interpretation of Jeremiah 8:8 is true and all verses not supporting your view of animal sacrifice are forgeries. It would be a roundabout way of circular reasoning, but without any other positive evidence there\u2019s not much more to do.\n\nWhere does Jesus disobey the Old Testament?\n\nWhat is your evidence for Ezra being responsible for an unnecessary redaction of the Old Testament?\n\nYes, Prophet Daniel referenced the Law given by Moses. We only see this Law referred to in an authoritative manner and no statements of the Law's untrustworthiness. \n\n\"However given that it literally contradicts the very sermon it's part of on nearly every point, let alone all the other times Jesus denounces the supposed law\"\nHow so?\n\n\"and isn't attested anywhere else except a one-liner in Luke that seems edited in and is in an entirely different spot\"\nInformation only attested in one gospel is hardly evidence of a forgery. There could be a debate if the information contradicts information in other gospels, but this isn't the case. Also, I'm not seeing anything about it in Luke.\n\nUnless we find an OT law about picking and eating grain on the Sabbath, this is Jesus calling the Teachers out on condemning due to manmade traditions(Mark 7:1-9). To get the point across, he acknowledges that David, a man they held in high regard, did not follow their tradition. Along with this, we see many references Jesus gave to the OT, though he does not once put it under the level of the authoritative Word of God.", "body_html": "<p>In every instance of God condemning animal sacrifice, without exception, his people are ignoring God\u2019s commands and utilizing sacrifice as a mere ceremonial, ritual obedience.

And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cThe man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\u201d And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses.\u201d\n\nThe death penalty for violating the sabbath was originally set in Exodus 31:14,\n\u201cYou shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d\n\nGranted, this could be what led the Pharisees into condemning picking up any item on the sabbath. However, the command for the Sabbath was not to work, and we can logically assume:\n\n1. The man was not gathering sticks for no reason.\n2. The man was not gathering sticks to prepare an offering, which is permitted in Numbers 28:9, and confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 12, and would ironically be considered to \u201cprofane\u201d the sabbath by the Pharisees(\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?\u201d)\n\nThe most rational conclusion would be that this man was gathering sticks in a work effort involving sticks, thereby deserving of his penalty. However, \u201cwork\u201d does not mean getting out of bed in the morning, nor does it mean lifting up food to eat, such as Jesus were.\n\n> \"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction. \n\nNo? It\u2019s a plainly true statement. Jesus acknowledges that Man was created, then the Sabbath was created as a day to cease working, in remembrance of God ceasing the creation of the universe on the seventh day. This is contradictory to the Pharisees\u2019 idea that Man cannot be healed on the Sabbath, despite it not being work. It\u2019s only a \u201cmajor contradiction\u201d if you distort the idea of the Sabbath.\n\n> The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time. \nNo. We see, by the Matthew 12 example, that they followed a misinterpretation of the sabbath.\n\n> When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.\n\nWhen you try to reconcile all contradictory ideas, it would end up with things like Marcionism. If we instead review each idea and it\u2019s individual merit, while accepting that, upon review, most interpretations simply don\u2019t hold water, such as God condemning animal sacrifice, we do not end up with things like Marcionism. If we were to have two historical accounts,\nJohn entered the code 3815 to the safe at 11:00 pm. It opened. He closed it.\nJohn entered the code 2815 to the safe at 11:03 pm.

Also, it was the wrong code,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.\nIf I were to say, \u201cAlright, the safe can\u2019t be racist and nonexistant at the same time, the first historical account is fake,\u201d I could be taken even less seriously. \nWith the information we have, we can say \u201cIt was the wrong code,\u201d is the interpretation we should follow.\n\n> The typical excuse for doing this is called dispensationalism, where Jesus apparently \"fulfilled the law, well at least the parts we don't like, we'll still keep the ones we like to judge others for\" which there is no evidence of whatsoever.\n\n\u201cNo evidence whatsoever\u201d is flippantly incorrect, but you can disprove the evidence, such as attempted with sacrifice prior.\n\n> If it were true then why does Jesus rebuke people for not following the supposed \"new way\" pre-Atonement?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying here. What \u201cnew way?\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe whole format of the sermon (and basically his entire ministry) for one: \"You have heard it said...but I say to you do not do that, but do this instead\". Almost every time he says that he's quoting an Old Testament law and condemning it.\u201d\n\nThe quotes in question will be Matthew 5:21, 27, 31, 33, 38, and 43.\n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201d\n\nWe can reason that Jesus does not wish to abolish the command \u201cYou shall not murder,\u201d as either side of the argument contains to records of God ruling murder acceptable, nor does there exist record of God opposed to judgment for murder. Jesus does not reject that God commanded against murder, but it is in His power to evolve the command. Though it was not yet revealed in the Old Testament due to the hard hearts of man, Jesus is enforcing the command against murder to it\u2019s roots, malice towards one\u2019s brother. In mentioning the established command, he demonstrates the base for his enforcement on the spiritual grounds of non-love towards a fellow Man. Though the OT command allowed some flexibility in this regard, Jesus stiffened the command, as it would now be efficient in causing more good in the world as those with softer hearts can now understand. \n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\u201d\n\nJesus again doesn\u2019t disagree with the command against adultery, but it allows that outside the physical. The complete commandment against adultery, a command against lust outside the physical, at the time of the OT would be a failure of efficiency and ultimately reject the Old and New Testament concept of God using others\u2019 choices of evil to establish good. Though it could be done with \u201cgood intentions\u201d, God knows better than to declare a command that would only cause greater evil with no regard to the good of the future.\n\n\u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u201d\n\nThough the original command\u2019s allowance of divorce on the basis of indecency seems to allow flexibility, to the reason defined prior, Jesus again builds upon the command, evolving indecency to sexual immorality. \n\n\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.\u201d\n\nWe can copy/paste the prior interpretations here, though it would be worth noting that Jesus was, most likely, speaking in hyperbole. Rather than rebuking all solemn oaths and vows, Jesus would\u2019ve been rebuking the misuse of God in a non-reverent nature, such as \u201cI swear to God!\u201d\n\nYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n\nThough the OT never said to hate your enemy, there were likely many at this time who took \u201cneighbor\u201d to mean ally, therefore allowing one to hate one\u2019s enemy. Jesus concludes this section of the Sermon by giving a command to love one\u2019s enemies.\n\n> And the most fundamental problem is that there is ZERO evidence of God ever sanctioning \"The Bible\". He did not drop it out of the sky one day, and he did not ever say it was protected from error. It was put together by humans, copied over the millenia by humans, and made into a replacement for the spirit by humans. \n\nGod dropping The Bible from the sky obviously isn\u2019t the only way to examine it\u2019s authenticity, and repeating \"no evidence\" doesn't change that. One way to examine authenticity would be to see what Jesus Himself said about the OT, which was put together by humans, and examine the NT.\n\n(1/2)", "body_html": "<p>\u201cWhile the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cThe man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\u201d And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses.\u201d</p>\n<p>The death penalty for violating the sabbath was originally set in Exodus 31:14,\n\u201cYou shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Granted, this could be what led the Pharisees into condemning picking up any item on the sabbath. However, the command for the Sabbath was not to work, and we can logically assume:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The man was not gathering sticks for no reason.</li>\n<li>The man was not gathering sticks to prepare an offering, which is permitted in Numbers 28:9, and confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 12, and would ironically be considered to \u201cprofane\u201d the sabbath by the Pharisees(\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?\u201d)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most rational conclusion would be that this man was gathering sticks in a work effort involving sticks, thereby deserving of his penalty. However, \u201cwork\u201d does not mean getting out of bed in the morning, nor does it mean lifting up food to eat, such as Jesus were.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No? It\u2019s a plainly true statement. Jesus acknowledges that Man was created, then the Sabbath was created as a day to cease working, in remembrance of God ceasing the creation of the universe on the seventh day. This is contradictory to the Pharisees\u2019 idea that Man cannot be healed on the Sabbath, despite it not being work. It\u2019s only a \u201cmajor contradiction\u201d if you distort the idea of the Sabbath.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time.\nNo. We see, by the Matthew 12 example, that they followed a misinterpretation of the sabbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you try to reconcile all contradictory ideas, it would end up with things like Marcionism. If we instead review each idea and it\u2019s individual merit, while accepting that, upon review, most interpretations simply don\u2019t hold water, such as God condemning animal sacrifice, we do not end up with things like Marcionism.

And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cThe man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\u201d And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses.\u201d\n\nThe death penalty for violating the sabbath was originally set in Exodus 31:14,\n\u201cYou shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d\n\nGranted, this could be what led the Pharisees into condemning picking up any item on the sabbath. However, the command for the Sabbath was not to work, and we can logically assume:\n\n1. The man was not gathering sticks for no reason.\n2. The man was not gathering sticks to prepare an offering, which is permitted in Numbers 28:9, and confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 12, and would ironically be considered to \u201cprofane\u201d the sabbath by the Pharisees(\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?\u201d)\n\nThe most rational conclusion would be that this man was gathering sticks in a work effort involving sticks, thereby deserving of his penalty. However, \u201cwork\u201d does not mean getting out of bed in the morning, nor does it mean lifting up food to eat, such as Jesus were.\n\n> \"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction. \n\nNo? It\u2019s a plainly true statement. Jesus acknowledges that Man was created, then the Sabbath was created as a day to cease working, in remembrance of God ceasing the creation of the universe on the seventh day. This is contradictory to the Pharisees\u2019 idea that Man cannot be healed on the Sabbath, despite it not being work. It\u2019s only a \u201cmajor contradiction\u201d if you distort the idea of the Sabbath.\n\n> The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time. \nNo. We see, by the Matthew 12 example, that they followed a misinterpretation of the sabbath.\n\n> When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.\n\nWhen you try to reconcile all contradictory ideas, it would end up with things like Marcionism. If we instead review each idea and it\u2019s individual merit, while accepting that, upon review, most interpretations simply don\u2019t hold water, such as God condemning animal sacrifice, we do not end up with things like Marcionism. If we were to have two historical accounts,\nJohn entered the code 3815 to the safe at 11:00 pm. It opened. He closed it.\nJohn entered the code 2815 to the safe at 11:03 pm.

The first account is fake, and between the first and second account are different Johns. Also, it was the wrong code,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.\nIf I were to say, \u201cAlright, the safe can\u2019t be racist and nonexistant at the same time, the first historical account is fake,\u201d I could be taken even less seriously. \nWith the information we have, we can say \u201cIt was the wrong code,\u201d is the interpretation we should follow.\n\n> The typical excuse for doing this is called dispensationalism, where Jesus apparently \"fulfilled the law, well at least the parts we don't like, we'll still keep the ones we like to judge others for\" which there is no evidence of whatsoever.\n\n\u201cNo evidence whatsoever\u201d is flippantly incorrect, but you can disprove the evidence, such as attempted with sacrifice prior.\n\n> If it were true then why does Jesus rebuke people for not following the supposed \"new way\" pre-Atonement?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying here. What \u201cnew way?\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe whole format of the sermon (and basically his entire ministry) for one: \"You have heard it said...but I say to you do not do that, but do this instead\". Almost every time he says that he's quoting an Old Testament law and condemning it.\u201d\n\nThe quotes in question will be Matthew 5:21, 27, 31, 33, 38, and 43.\n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201d\n\nWe can reason that Jesus does not wish to abolish the command \u201cYou shall not murder,\u201d as either side of the argument contains to records of God ruling murder acceptable, nor does there exist record of God opposed to judgment for murder. Jesus does not reject that God commanded against murder, but it is in His power to evolve the command. Though it was not yet revealed in the Old Testament due to the hard hearts of man, Jesus is enforcing the command against murder to it\u2019s roots, malice towards one\u2019s brother. In mentioning the established command, he demonstrates the base for his enforcement on the spiritual grounds of non-love towards a fellow Man. Though the OT command allowed some flexibility in this regard, Jesus stiffened the command, as it would now be efficient in causing more good in the world as those with softer hearts can now understand. \n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\u201d\n\nJesus again doesn\u2019t disagree with the command against adultery, but it allows that outside the physical. The complete commandment against adultery, a command against lust outside the physical, at the time of the OT would be a failure of efficiency and ultimately reject the Old and New Testament concept of God using others\u2019 choices of evil to establish good. Though it could be done with \u201cgood intentions\u201d, God knows better than to declare a command that would only cause greater evil with no regard to the good of the future.\n\n\u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u201d\n\nThough the original command\u2019s allowance of divorce on the basis of indecency seems to allow flexibility, to the reason defined prior, Jesus again builds upon the command, evolving indecency to sexual immorality. \n\n\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.\u201d\n\nWe can copy/paste the prior interpretations here, though it would be worth noting that Jesus was, most likely, speaking in hyperbole. Rather than rebuking all solemn oaths and vows, Jesus would\u2019ve been rebuking the misuse of God in a non-reverent nature, such as \u201cI swear to God!\u201d\n\nYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n\nThough the OT never said to hate your enemy, there were likely many at this time who took \u201cneighbor\u201d to mean ally, therefore allowing one to hate one\u2019s enemy. Jesus concludes this section of the Sermon by giving a command to love one\u2019s enemies.\n\n> And the most fundamental problem is that there is ZERO evidence of God ever sanctioning \"The Bible\". He did not drop it out of the sky one day, and he did not ever say it was protected from error. It was put together by humans, copied over the millenia by humans, and made into a replacement for the spirit by humans. \n\nGod dropping The Bible from the sky obviously isn\u2019t the only way to examine it\u2019s authenticity, and repeating \"no evidence\" doesn't change that. One way to examine authenticity would be to see what Jesus Himself said about the OT, which was put together by humans, and examine the NT.\n\n(1/2)", "body_html": "<p>\u201cWhile the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

Though it could be done with \u201cgood intentions\u201d, God knows better than to declare a command that would only cause greater evil with no regard to the good of the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Though the original command\u2019s allowance of divorce on the basis of indecency seems to allow flexibility, to the reason defined prior, Jesus again builds upon the command, evolving indecency to sexual immorality.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>We can copy/paste the prior interpretations here, though it would be worth noting that Jesus was, most likely, speaking in hyperbole. Rather than rebuking all solemn oaths and vows, Jesus would\u2019ve been rebuking the misuse of God in a non-reverent nature, such as \u201cI swear to God!\u201d</p>\n<p>You have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>\n<p>Though the OT never said to hate your enemy, there were likely many at this time who took \u201cneighbor\u201d to mean ally, therefore allowing one to hate one\u2019s enemy. Jesus concludes this section of the Sermon by giving a command to love one\u2019s enemies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the most fundamental problem is that there is ZERO evidence of God ever sanctioning \"The Bible\".

And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him. And the Lord said to Moses, \u201cThe man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\u201d And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses.\u201d\n\nThe death penalty for violating the sabbath was originally set in Exodus 31:14,\n\u201cYou shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d\n\nGranted, this could be what led the Pharisees into condemning picking up any item on the sabbath. However, the command for the Sabbath was not to work, and we can logically assume:\n\n1. The man was not gathering sticks for no reason.\n2. The man was not gathering sticks to prepare an offering, which is permitted in Numbers 28:9, and confirmed by Jesus in Matthew 12, and would ironically be considered to \u201cprofane\u201d the sabbath by the Pharisees(\u201cOr have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?\u201d)\n\nThe most rational conclusion would be that this man was gathering sticks in a work effort involving sticks, thereby deserving of his penalty. However, \u201cwork\u201d does not mean getting out of bed in the morning, nor does it mean lifting up food to eat, such as Jesus were.\n\n> \"Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man\". This alone is a major contradiction. \n\nNo? It\u2019s a plainly true statement. Jesus acknowledges that Man was created, then the Sabbath was created as a day to cease working, in remembrance of God ceasing the creation of the universe on the seventh day. This is contradictory to the Pharisees\u2019 idea that Man cannot be healed on the Sabbath, despite it not being work. It\u2019s only a \u201cmajor contradiction\u201d if you distort the idea of the Sabbath.\n\n> The Pharisees were following the prescription just as it was written in their time. \nNo. We see, by the Matthew 12 example, that they followed a misinterpretation of the sabbath.\n\n> When you try to reconcile so many contradicting ideas you end up with things like Marcionism, or like most of modern Christendom picking and choosing the parts that align with the preferred theology and ignoring those that don't.\n\nWhen you try to reconcile all contradictory ideas, it would end up with things like Marcionism. If we instead review each idea and it\u2019s individual merit, while accepting that, upon review, most interpretations simply don\u2019t hold water, such as God condemning animal sacrifice, we do not end up with things like Marcionism.

What \u201cnew way?\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe whole format of the sermon (and basically his entire ministry) for one: \"You have heard it said...but I say to you do not do that, but do this instead\". Almost every time he says that he's quoting an Old Testament law and condemning it.\u201d\n\nThe quotes in question will be Matthew 5:21, 27, 31, 33, 38, and 43.\n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, \u2018You fool!\u2019 will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201d\n\nWe can reason that Jesus does not wish to abolish the command \u201cYou shall not murder,\u201d as either side of the argument contains to records of God ruling murder acceptable, nor does there exist record of God opposed to judgment for murder. Jesus does not reject that God commanded against murder, but it is in His power to evolve the command. Though it was not yet revealed in the Old Testament due to the hard hearts of man, Jesus is enforcing the command against murder to it\u2019s roots, malice towards one\u2019s brother. In mentioning the established command, he demonstrates the base for his enforcement on the spiritual grounds of non-love towards a fellow Man. Though the OT command allowed some flexibility in this regard, Jesus stiffened the command, as it would now be efficient in causing more good in the world as those with softer hearts can now understand. \n\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\u201d\n\nJesus again doesn\u2019t disagree with the command against adultery, but it allows that outside the physical.

Though it could be done with \u201cgood intentions\u201d, God knows better than to declare a command that would only cause greater evil with no regard to the good of the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.\u2019 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Though the original command\u2019s allowance of divorce on the basis of indecency seems to allow flexibility, to the reason defined prior, Jesus again builds upon the command, evolving indecency to sexual immorality.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, \u2018You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything more than this comes from evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>We can copy/paste the prior interpretations here, though it would be worth noting that Jesus was, most likely, speaking in hyperbole. Rather than rebuking all solemn oaths and vows, Jesus would\u2019ve been rebuking the misuse of God in a non-reverent nature, such as \u201cI swear to God!\u201d</p>\n<p>You have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>\n<p>Though the OT never said to hate your enemy, there were likely many at this time who took \u201cneighbor\u201d to mean ally, therefore allowing one to hate one\u2019s enemy. Jesus concludes this section of the Sermon by giving a command to love one\u2019s enemies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the most fundamental problem is that there is ZERO evidence of God ever sanctioning \"The Bible\". He did not drop it out of the sky one day, and he did not ever say it was protected from error. It was put together by humans, copied over the millenia by humans, and made into a replacement for the spirit by humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God dropping The Bible from the sky obviously isn\u2019t the only way to examine it\u2019s authenticity, and repeating \"no evidence\" doesn't change that. One way to examine authenticity would be to see what Jesus Himself said about the OT, which was put together by humans, and examine the NT.</p>\n<p>(1/2)</p>\n", "created_utc": 1627332773, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1627333333, "fullname": "t3_13lkz", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "13lkz", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 19, "parent_comment_id": ["13ci8"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/co9h/what-is-the-great-falling-away/13lkz", "post_id": "co9h", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["13lkz"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/co9h/what-is-the-great-falling-away/13lvh", "post": {"author_name": null, "award_count": 0, "body": "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first.\r\n\r\n 2 Thessalonians 2:3 (KJV).", "body_html": "<p>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first.</p>\n<p>2 Thessalonians 2:3 (KJV).</p>\n", "comment_count": 44, "created_utc": 1626294511, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_co9h", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "co9h", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/co9h/what-is-the-great-falling-away", "score": 5, "thumb_url": null, "title": "What is the great falling away?", "upvotes": 4, "url": ""}, "post_id": "co9h", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
