I'm not an infalliblist (is that a word?) but just for practical purposes, you kinda have to take the New Testament as a body of work or not, because it's literally impossible to know what's legitimate and what isn't. Homologoumena and Antilegomena certainly don't hold up as categories anymore. The Critical Scholars take their guesses, but they also have a habit of smelling smoke where no fire exists. Instead, it's best to take it as \"good enough to get a pretty reasonable idea of what the ideal Christian archetype is.\"</p>\n<p>That's also what the early Church Fathers were, and I don't think you can throw them out either. Not because of some wishful notion of consensus like the Roman Catholics have. They aren't perfect, but they're also a lot more connected to the society from which Christianity emerged than we can ever hope to be, they likely had knowledge and sources that we don't even know exist. A lot gets lost in transmission over two thousand years, even when it's written down, because the language fundamentally changes. The Fathers are our lighthouses.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1626832916, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_1387e", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "1387e", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 7, "parent_comment_id": ["13818"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a/1387e", "post_id": "cs90", "score": 2, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["1387e"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a/138s7", "post": {"author_name": "ArchibaldCoolstep", "award_count": 0, "body": "I personally get a little irritated when someone of wealth and stature says they follow Christ's teachings.", "body_html": "<p>I personally get a little irritated when someone of wealth and stature says they follow Christ's teachings.</p>\n", "comment_count": 65, "created_utc": 1626752476, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_cs90", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "cs90", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cs90/is-it-possible-to-be-a", "score": 3, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Is it possible to be a wealthy Christian?", "upvotes": 5, "url": ""}, "post_id": "cs90", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}
