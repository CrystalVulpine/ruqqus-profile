How it got misrepresented afterward as two separate gods isn't hard to fathom considering the pagan-infested days of Israel and Judah. They also wouldn't have been comfortable with feminine aspects of God considering how wives were literally purchased in the ancient world, so I'm sure a lot of them liked assigning it all to \"God's wife\" instead. And considering how marriage doesn't even exist in the new world, nor ever among angels and spiritual beings (except Nephilim)--and according to the ancient understanding probably not gender either--it's a bit of a stretch to think God is a literal man married to a literal goddess. That's more of a pagan idea, and paganism itself probably stems from these kinds of misrepresentations of the one god. It's easy to see how monotheistic metaphors for an omnisicient entity could become corrupted over the generations into stories about literal god people in the sky who are just magical humans, but that being the original story and taken seriously is outlandish.</p>\n<p>Mary was merely a biological parent who birthed Jesus. A normal human. And considering the evidence, probably with Joseph's seed.

Because God is the Divine Ideal, or the Archetype, and the ideal archetype is not necessarily the same between the older and the younger, the man and the woman, etc. so even a monotheistic God may have different presentations. It's also why the history of the Saints are important, they're a subset of this presentation made physical. We see a similar ideal being expressed in infinite varieties over time, and extract the meta, Christlike ideal from it.</p>\n<p>I don't think there's a God named Yahweh and a God named Sophia hanging out in Heaven spending all their time engaged in spirit sex, I'm not a Mormon. I don't necessarily think Yahweh as he's presented in the Old Testament is the pure expression of whatever God is either, though it's the closest thing we have. I think God presents himself as El, or Yahweh, or the Father, and also presents himself as Sophia, who is the Holy Mother and advocate against Yahweh's jealous wrath, God is entirely both of these things, it's not polytheism.</p>\n<p>Gnostics had an incorrect cosmology, but they were definitely onto something in separating the naive, stupid \"gods\" from the great immaterial, boundless God. It's a Platonic expression of Enlightenment philosophy over a thousand years prior to the Enlightenment. Absolutely revolutionary, and a realization I had about Sethianism in particular only recently.</p>\n","created_utc":1627322802,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":1627322920,"fullname":"t3_13l5s","guild_id":"41","herald_guild":null,"id":"13l5s","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":9,"parent_comment_id":["13l1w"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cwar/why-did-god-create-2-genders/13l5s","post_id":"cwar","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["13l5s"],"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cwar/why-did-god-create-2-genders/13lbw","post":{"guild_name":"Christianity","id":"cwar","is_banned":false,"is_deleted":true,"permalink":"/+Christianity/post/cwar/why-did-god-create-2-genders","title":"Why did God create 2 genders?"},"post_id":"cwar","score":1,"upvotes":1,"voted":0}
