Why would they need to if Jesus was enough?</p>\n<p>Do you remember the Ethiopian in Acts 8:27? He was reading the Torah and Philip told him about Jesus using the passage he was reading. Clearly this is a mistake since the Torah is useless and Jesus is enough.</p>\n<p>The Torah Is the Bible and the King James is also the Bible because the Bible IS the Word of God, and by hearing the Word of God we have faith. It's not useless.</p>\n<p>Also, to answer the Bible question, just because the Dark ages had a distinct lack of literate people and copies of the Bible, doesn't mean the rest of the thousand years were the same. We have manuscripts of the original Gospels going back to the first century. Even Wikipedia admits that much.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript</a></p>\n<p>And we also have compilations of Bibles going back to near the time of Christ. Just look at this Ethiopian Bible. Dont you think that if the Ethiopians had a version of a Bible, that the Hebrews and Greeks and Romans might have one also?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://orthochristian.com/94812.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://orthochristian.com/94812.html</a></p>\n<p>Don't assume that just because you're an enlightened 21st century intellectual, that all people living before you were idiots. People are smart, even back then. If they see something that looks like the Gods Word, they will hold on to it and pass it along.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1627356177, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_13mao", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "13mao", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 5, "parent_comment_id": ["13m7r"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have/13mao", "post_id": "cx72", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["13mao"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have/13s2k", "post": {"author_name": "ArchibaldCoolstep", "award_count": 0, "body": "The authors of the Bible, the Nicean Council, Martin Luther, Scofield, etc... have no authority over me, Christ does - He alone is the word of God.", "body_html": "<p>The authors of the Bible, the Nicean Council, Martin Luther, Scofield, etc... have no authority over me, Christ does - He alone is the word of God.</p>\n", "comment_count": 79, "created_utc": 1627324812, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_cx72", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "cx72", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have", "score": 12, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Some of the Churches I have visited recently have said that the Bible is the authority in my life", "upvotes": 13, "url": ""}, "post_id": "cx72", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}

If God is real, why wouldn't He direct people to write down what He said? Why wouldn't He attempt to keep His word pure? Why wouldn't He inspire groups of people to purge false documents from it? Is He that weak of a God that He would allow His Word to be corrupted?</p>\n<p>Take this analogy. If a government wants to institute a new speed limit on a road, they need to announce the new law, put up a sign with the new speed limit on it, and then replace the sign if it gets damaged. Same with God. He announced His Law, then gave the people the Law who wrote it down, and then He preserved it.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1628111832, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_149a3", "guild_id": "41", "herald_guild": null, "id": "149a3", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 3, "parent_comment_id": ["13s21"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have/149a3", "post_id": "cx72", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["149a3"], "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have/149c9", "post": {"author_name": "ArchibaldCoolstep", "award_count": 0, "body": "The authors of the Bible, the Nicean Council, Martin Luther, Scofield, etc... have no authority over me, Christ does - He alone is the word of God.", "body_html": "<p>The authors of the Bible, the Nicean Council, Martin Luther, Scofield, etc... have no authority over me, Christ does - He alone is the word of God.</p>\n", "comment_count": 79, "created_utc": 1627324812, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_cx72", "guild_id": "41", "guild_name": "Christianity", "herald_guild": null, "id": "cx72", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_title": "", "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+Christianity/post/cx72/some-of-the-churches-i-have", "score": 11, "thumb_url": null, "title": "Some of the Churches I have visited recently have said that the Bible is the authority in my life", "upvotes": 13, "url": ""}, "post_id": "cx72", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": 0}

It's a prophecy given to king Ahaz during the Syro-Ephraimite war, 8th century BCE. The prophecy is about the fall of the Syro-Ephraimite military alligiance at the hands of Assyria. This would happen and happened when the child the young women carried would reach a certain age of maturity (v.15).

And it's not just a misappropriated, fabricated prophecy, it's not just a willful mistranslation -- the Church build upon this narrative. They peddled the theophoric Hebrew personal name Immanuel as some kind of divine title of an incarnate pagan God-man abomination. Churches carry that name all over the world. Theologians, priests, pastors, apologists, all of them have peddled this filthy lie for almost 2000 years. This is *one* single example of a satanic, idolatrous lie peddled by the Church and Christianity, albeit very important in setting the state.
