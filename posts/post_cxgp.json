It's not something you would practically perform in a house.\r\n\r\nNo, historians agree. Paul's real letters indicate this. The only church authority Paul recognizes is the \"pillars of the church\" and himself (and Paul is a huge boaster who naturally exaggerates his importance). The church started almost immediately after this, and they wrote things like 1 Timothy and Titus and the Gospel of \"Matthew\" to \"prove\" their authority.\r\n\r\n> You seem to be under the impression that the Enlightenment concept of religion is the canonical one dating back to the beginning of recorded history. It isn't, you sound ridiculous every time you make these claims.\r\n\r\nIt's in the Bible too. And all our manuscripts are pre-Enlightenment, so it could not have been redacted then. In fact Christianity is largely responsible for the Enlightenment.\r\n\r\n> \"It totally happened guys, just trust me. I don't have any proof but I pinky promise!\"\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of internal evidence. Even entire books were rewritten. They censored the sources behind the canonical gospels and there's some evidence that they cut Mark too. The Pauline epistles were rearranged as to change the context and are filled to the brim with interpolations. One of the smaller redactions we have proof of (the so-called Byzantine text type).
