During her peak fertility phase, a women will be attracted to masculine features and traits (broadly termed as Alpha) and at her low fertility phase, she will be attracted to men with more effeminate features and traits (broadly-termed as Beta).</p>\n<p>There are many studies proving women's dual-mating strategy (one recent example here, which I've written a lengthy reply to: <a href=\"https://ruqqus.com/+MGTOW/post/d5dy/double-mating-strategy-scientific-study-by\" target=\"_blank\">https://ruqqus.com/+MGTOW/post/d5dy/double-mating-strategy-scientific-study-by</a>).</p>\n<p>Her sexual selection changes depending on her ovulation cycle.</p>\n<p>Secondly, when a woman is in the phase where she is attracted to resources - it is actually her measurement of provisioning ability and she perceives this via signalling - in modern times a guy signals by wearing a fitting suit, a nice watch, holding keys to a flashy car catches more interest than a guy dressed in a T-shirt and sandals.</p>\n<p>In primitive times when no one owned anything (eg. the hunter-gatherer tribes that exist in remote jungles in Papua and Indonesia), even amongst the tribesmen there would always be individuals who would be relatively better at something eg. Tribesman A, would perhaps excel in hunting, and would signal his provisioning ability via a necklace of canine teeth from the various beasts he has killed; Tribesman B perhaps excelled at weaving fibres into clothes and would signal his provisioning ability via woven clothing, etc.</p>\n<p>Status perception also changes based on relative abundance/scarcity of the season - eg. During fruiting season when gathering is plentiful and stomachs are full, the relative status of the hunter A isn't high as compared to times when fruits are scarce, food is hard to gather and stomaches are hungry.</p>\n","created_utc":1628273471,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_14ghq","guild_id":"29","herald_guild":null,"id":"14ghq","is_archived":false,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":2,"parent_comment_id":["14fmb"],"permalink":"/+MGTOW/post/d5gc/we-are-hated-for-accepting-reality/14ghq","post_id":"d5gc","score":2,"upvotes":2,"voted":null},"parent_comment_id":["14ghq"],"permalink":"/+MGTOW/post/d5gc/we-are-hated-for-accepting-reality/14gzl","post":{"author_name":"TigPlaze","award_count":0,"body":"We accept the fact of hypergamy, and that pisses people off.

One used to work to override hypergamy with good values, values that said you take a vow to spend your life with one person and be loyal to that one person through thick and thin.
