As close as my grandmother's generation, women had almost no rights--to their person, their children, to an income even, education\r\n\r\nThis has never been the case, and it is a gross misunderstanding of history to present things that way. \r\nMen are women in the past had very different roles and both were necessary, but one was no better than the other, they both sucked quite a bit. Life was terribly brutal, short and exceedingly hard for both men and women.\r\n\r\nHistorically and up until fairly recently, only landowners (the rich 1-5%) could vote, which excluded some 95-99% of BOTH men AND women. \r\nAnd where there were rich men landowners, there were rich women landowners as well and those women DID vote, they did hold jobs and were highly educated. The registry in London has these women recorded as voters and landowners as far back as to the 1600s.\r\n\r\nFor the vast majority (95+%) of the population though, life a was hard brutal struggle, full of heavy demanding physical labour - flip a coin and any common cold and illness in general will kill you. \r\nYou cut your hand? Better not hope you get sepsis and die. There were no guaranteed cures or treatments, no antibiotics and modern medicines. Both men and women often died well before their 30s, and that is if they were lucky enough to live past birth.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is the vast majority of men AND women did what they could to survive, and they did that via division of labour. They had their roles and these were forced on them by the courts.\r\nWomen held the means to produce children, were protected by men and the courts and laws at the time, so Women were expected to bear many children, continuously (8 was pretty common as the mortality rate was just so high that only 1 or 2 would make it to adulthood), and because of that role, women were also largely protected from the dirtiest and heaviest of physical labour and danger and shielded from going down coal mines, to sea, and to war. \r\nMen were expected to do the hardest, the heaviest, the dirtiest, most dangerous of physical labour, and to go off in wars to fight and die.\r\nIt was also because of that role (childbearing) that women had little time for education as a good decade of a women's adult life was dedicated to pop out children (don't forget that children were also drafted into physical labour at the earliest age possible).\r\n\r\nIts not that women were denied education by men, for the rich upper class women were educated, some chose to  become doctors and scientists and inventors, and did work.\r\nYou can't glamorise it and say women were denied from being doctors - no the courts protected women by denying them from going to war and dying of a stab wound or a cut or trench foot. They were denied from working coal mines, in the sea, under ground, at heights. \r\nThey were expected to work at home, working hard, doing less dangerous work, but it was hard work nonetheless.\r\n\r\nYou can't say men had it better either, or that they treated women like dirt, and that the courts were against women.\r\nWomen had the right to their own money, which their husband could not touch, yet the husband was held responsible by the courts for any of the woman's debts. As the main labourer and workhorse, Men were held responsible for providing for the children.\r\n\r\nIn short, you can't cherry pick and take only the top 1% of men, compare the bottom 99% of women and say that men had the upper hand and shit all over women. The vast majority of men and women were forced into roles, whether they wanted to or not. And life was short, shitty, and brutal unless you happened to be a rich landowner. Anywhere where women were oppressed, men were too.","body_html":"<blockquote>\n<p>It wasn't that long ago that Men had the upper hand and women were being completely shit on in every way possible.

Life was terribly brutal, short and exceedingly hard for both men and women.</p>\n<p>Historically and up until fairly recently, only landowners (the rich 1-5%) could vote, which excluded some 95-99% of BOTH men AND women. \nAnd where there were rich men landowners, there were rich women landowners as well and those women DID vote, they did hold jobs and were highly educated. The registry in London has these women recorded as voters and landowners as far back as to the 1600s.</p>\n<p>For the vast majority (95+%) of the population though, life a was hard brutal struggle, full of heavy demanding physical labour - flip a coin and any common cold and illness in general will kill you. \nYou cut your hand? Better not hope you get sepsis and die. There were no guaranteed cures or treatments, no antibiotics and modern medicines. Both men and women often died well before their 30s, and that is if they were lucky enough to live past birth.</p>\n<p>The sad truth is the vast majority of men AND women did what they could to survive, and they did that via division of labour. They had their roles and these were forced on them by the courts.\nWomen held the means to produce children, were protected by men and the courts and laws at the time, so Women were expected to bear many children, continuously (8 was pretty common as the mortality rate was just so high that only 1 or 2 would make it to adulthood), and because of that role, women were also largely protected from the dirtiest and heaviest of physical labour and danger and shielded from going down coal mines, to sea, and to war. \nMen were expected to do the hardest, the heaviest, the dirtiest, most dangerous of physical labour, and to go off in wars to fight and die.\nIt was also because of that role (childbearing) that women had little time for education as a good decade of a women's adult life was dedicated to pop out children (don't forget that children were also drafted into physical labour at the earliest age possible).</p>\n<p>Its not that women were denied education by men, for the rich upper class women were educated, some chose to  become doctors and scientists and inventors, and did work.\nYou can't glamorise it and say women were denied from being doctors - no the courts protected women by denying them from going to war and dying of a stab wound or a cut or trench foot. They were denied from working coal mines, in the sea, under ground, at heights. \nThey were expected to work at home, working hard, doing less dangerous work, but it was hard work nonetheless.</p>\n<p>You can't say men had it better either, or that they treated women like dirt, and that the courts were against women.\nWomen had the right to their own money, which their husband could not touch, yet the husband was held responsible by the courts for any of the woman's debts. As the main labourer and workhorse, Men were held responsible for providing for the children.</p>\n<p>In short, you can't cherry pick and take only the top 1% of men, compare the bottom 99% of women and say that men had the upper hand and shit all over women. The vast majority of men and women were forced into roles, whether they wanted to or not. And life was short, shitty, and brutal unless you happened to be a rich landowner. Anywhere where women were oppressed, men were too.</p>\n","created_utc":1628349852,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_14jby","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#7B9AE4","created_utc":1582833064,"description":"Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?

The applications from women who tried to take a credit card out under their name received the stamp of “denied” or told them to get their husband’s’ signature on the form. If the woman wasn’t married, the bank would still request she bring a male, such as her father or brother, who could co-sign the application.\n\nBefore the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, women could lose their jobs because of a pregnancy. The passing of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act stated that women could not get fired because they became pregnant as this was an act of discrimination against women. Of course, this didn’t mean that women would receive payment for the time they missed due to their pregnancy. It also didn’t say that they couldn’t be fired for “other reasons” once they became pregnant. The act just meant that the reason for firing a woman could not be because of her pregnancy.\n\nWomen were not allowed to attend a military academy because men believed that women would not be able to make through the academy. This idea changed when West Point admitted its first female students in 1976. Four years later, Andrea Hollen and 61 other females became the first women to graduate from a military academy on May 28, 1980. However, women couldn’t fight in combat until 2013, per a 1994 ban.\n\nWomen were not allowed to protect themselves from work place harassment. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission came up with a definition for sexual harassment and stated it created a hostile work environment. Six years later, the United States Supreme Court would agree with their ruling. 1986. Some of the people on this site are older than that. \n\nWomen didn’t receive direct consultation about their health from doctors. A wife had to have her husband speak on her behalf for many reasons; one being women couldn’t understand what the doctors were saying.\n\nWives finally started to receive some legal protection in the 1970s from their husbands. State courts began to realize that there was something called marital rape. However, very few states would do anything about any type of spousal rape accusations from a woman until the early 1990s with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. With this act, women became legally protected from any act of violence from their husband, including physical assault and rape. Before the action, many police departments around the United States believed any abuse from a husband towards his wife was a private family matter.\n\nWomen were not legally allowed to divorce their husbands without giving the Courts a reason, that was acceptable to a male judge. Not until the No-Fault Divorce Act in 1969. This act allowed women to obtain a divorce easier as they no longer had to prove their partner’s fault when requesting a divorce. 1969. Husbands, on the other hand, were often granted a divorce for any reason at all. \n\nWhile some states had selected female judges, women weren’t typically able to sit in the at a regular rate in the United States until the 1970s when the majority of states allowed women to serve as judges. In fact, women as judges is a slowly growing trend historically. \n\nThey weren't allowed to be astronauts. It was 1979 before  NASA first started hiring women so they could train them as an astronaut. Then, in 1983, Sally Ride became the first female astronaut to go up into space.\n\nIvy league colleges didn’t regularly accept women until close to the 1970s. Yale became the first ivy league college to admit women in 1969. After that, many other ivy league college started to accept women but at a pretty slow rate. For example, Columbia University didn’t allow women until 1983.\n\nWhile there were previous female judges and lawyers, it was scarce to see a woman in the legal field until the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. In fact, Cornell University ran a study which confirmed that 90% of law firms refused to interview women who applied for placement in their firms. On top of this, most law schools wouldn’t admit women into their programs.\n\nThe FDA approved birth control during the 1960s; however, individual states could create their own laws when it came to the birth control pill. Many states didn’t allow doctors to give their patients the birth control pill for various reasons. One woman from Connecticut, Estelle Griswold, started to sell the contraception, and was arrested. Her case went to the Supreme Court, which upheld that married women could receive the birth control pill in 1965. During the 1970s, more states started to allow doctors to prescribe the medication. Even then, most doctors still demanded permission from a woman's husband before they would prescribe it. \n\nPrior to the 1970s, females serving on a jury was rare but not impossible. It did happen but it hardly ever occurred before the 1970s, especially once the 20th Century rolled around. Allowing women to serve in a jury became a law for individual states to decide. Many states didn’t allow women to sit on a jury until 1973 when all 50 states made it a requirement that females were allowed to participate.\n\nWomen weren't allowed to sit on the Supreme Court. It wasn’t until right after the 1970s, in 1981, when Sandra Day O’Connor received a seat for the Supreme Court. She held this position until 2006 when she retired. Other than O’Connor, three other women have served on the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan.\n\nDuring the 1970s, many states had laws against living with your significant other before marriage. It wasn’t until 2013 when all 50 states adopted the law to allow couples to live together without getting married first.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 worked to end workplace discrimination; however, it continued in several states and among hundreds of professions. Even though employers couldn’t legally reject women for jobs because of their gender, they could reject women for other reasons. Some employers would skip applications by women while others would come up with a different reason for not hiring them.\n\nJust like women couldn’t get a credit card without their husband’s signature, they couldn’t open a bank account without their husband’s permission. One of the reasons was because people believed they wouldn’t be able to handle the financial part. It wasn't until the late 70's that women actually having their own bank account became more acceptable. \n\n\nThere are people on here old enough to remember this. I'm not talking about two hundred years ago. I'm talking about In the lifetime of your grandmother and maybe even your mother. \n\nAnd the courts, yes, were definitely skewed against women obtaining custody of their own children. And with good reason. If she had no education and she couldn't hold down a job due to discrimination, or one with a living wage, it was almost impossible for a woman to support her children so of course the courts gave custody more often to the father.","body_html":"<p>You're talking the 16-17 hundreds.

With this act, women became legally protected from any act of violence from their husband, including physical assault and rape. Before the action, many police departments around the United States believed any abuse from a husband towards his wife was a private family matter.</p>\n<p>Women were not legally allowed to divorce their husbands without giving the Courts a reason, that was acceptable to a male judge. Not until the No-Fault Divorce Act in 1969. This act allowed women to obtain a divorce easier as they no longer had to prove their partner’s fault when requesting a divorce. 1969. Husbands, on the other hand, were often granted a divorce for any reason at all.</p>\n<p>While some states had selected female judges, women weren’t typically able to sit in the at a regular rate in the United States until the 1970s when the majority of states allowed women to serve as judges. In fact, women as judges is a slowly growing trend historically.</p>\n<p>They weren't allowed to be astronauts. It was 1979 before  NASA first started hiring women so they could train them as an astronaut. Then, in 1983, Sally Ride became the first female astronaut to go up into space.</p>\n<p>Ivy league colleges didn’t regularly accept women until close to the 1970s. Yale became the first ivy league college to admit women in 1969. After that, many other ivy league college started to accept women but at a pretty slow rate. For example, Columbia University didn’t allow women until 1983.</p>\n<p>While there were previous female judges and lawyers, it was scarce to see a woman in the legal field until the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. In fact, Cornell University ran a study which confirmed that 90% of law firms refused to interview women who applied for placement in their firms. On top of this, most law schools wouldn’t admit women into their programs.</p>\n<p>The FDA approved birth control during the 1960s; however, individual states could create their own laws when it came to the birth control pill. Many states didn’t allow doctors to give their patients the birth control pill for various reasons. One woman from Connecticut, Estelle Griswold, started to sell the contraception, and was arrested. Her case went to the Supreme Court, which upheld that married women could receive the birth control pill in 1965. During the 1970s, more states started to allow doctors to prescribe the medication. Even then, most doctors still demanded permission from a woman's husband before they would prescribe it.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 1970s, females serving on a jury was rare but not impossible. It did happen but it hardly ever occurred before the 1970s, especially once the 20th Century rolled around. Allowing women to serve in a jury became a law for individual states to decide. Many states didn’t allow women to sit on a jury until 1973 when all 50 states made it a requirement that females were allowed to participate.</p>\n<p>Women weren't allowed to sit on the Supreme Court. It wasn’t until right after the 1970s, in 1981, when Sandra Day O’Connor received a seat for the Supreme Court. She held this position until 2006 when she retired. Other than O’Connor, three other women have served on the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan.</p>\n<p>During the 1970s, many states had laws against living with your significant other before marriage. It wasn’t until 2013 when all 50 states adopted the law to allow couples to live together without getting married first.</p>\n<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 worked to end workplace discrimination; however, it continued in several states and among hundreds of professions. Even though employers couldn’t legally reject women for jobs because of their gender, they could reject women for other reasons. Some employers would skip applications by women while others would come up with a different reason for not hiring them.</p>\n<p>Just like women couldn’t get a credit card without their husband’s signature, they couldn’t open a bank account without their husband’s permission. One of the reasons was because people believed they wouldn’t be able to handle the financial part. It wasn't until the late 70's that women actually having their own bank account became more acceptable.</p>\n<p>There are people on here old enough to remember this. I'm not talking about two hundred years ago. I'm talking about In the lifetime of your grandmother and maybe even your mother.</p>\n<p>And the courts, yes, were definitely skewed against women obtaining custody of their own children. And with good reason. If she had no education and she couldn't hold down a job due to discrimination, or one with a living wage, it was almost impossible for a woman to support her children so of course the courts gave custody more often to the father.</p>\n","created_utc":1628360844,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_14js5","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#7B9AE4","created_utc":1582833064,"description":"Got a burning unpopular opinion you want to share?

The applications from women who tried to take a credit card out under their name received the stamp of “denied” or told them to get their husband’s’ signature on the form. If the woman wasn’t married, the bank would still request she bring a male, such as her father or brother, who could co-sign the application.\n\nBefore the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, women could lose their jobs because of a pregnancy. The passing of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act stated that women could not get fired because they became pregnant as this was an act of discrimination against women. Of course, this didn’t mean that women would receive payment for the time they missed due to their pregnancy. It also didn’t say that they couldn’t be fired for “other reasons” once they became pregnant. The act just meant that the reason for firing a woman could not be because of her pregnancy.\n\nWomen were not allowed to attend a military academy because men believed that women would not be able to make through the academy. This idea changed when West Point admitted its first female students in 1976. Four years later, Andrea Hollen and 61 other females became the first women to graduate from a military academy on May 28, 1980. However, women couldn’t fight in combat until 2013, per a 1994 ban.\n\nWomen were not allowed to protect themselves from work place harassment. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission came up with a definition for sexual harassment and stated it created a hostile work environment. Six years later, the United States Supreme Court would agree with their ruling. 1986. Some of the people on this site are older than that. \n\nWomen didn’t receive direct consultation about their health from doctors. A wife had to have her husband speak on her behalf for many reasons; one being women couldn’t understand what the doctors were saying.\n\nWives finally started to receive some legal protection in the 1970s from their husbands. State courts began to realize that there was something called marital rape. However, very few states would do anything about any type of spousal rape accusations from a woman until the early 1990s with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. With this act, women became legally protected from any act of violence from their husband, including physical assault and rape. Before the action, many police departments around the United States believed any abuse from a husband towards his wife was a private family matter.\n\nWomen were not legally allowed to divorce their husbands without giving the Courts a reason, that was acceptable to a male judge. Not until the No-Fault Divorce Act in 1969. This act allowed women to obtain a divorce easier as they no longer had to prove their partner’s fault when requesting a divorce. 1969. Husbands, on the other hand, were often granted a divorce for any reason at all. \n\nWhile some states had selected female judges, women weren’t typically able to sit in the at a regular rate in the United States until the 1970s when the majority of states allowed women to serve as judges. In fact, women as judges is a slowly growing trend historically. \n\nThey weren't allowed to be astronauts. It was 1979 before  NASA first started hiring women so they could train them as an astronaut. Then, in 1983, Sally Ride became the first female astronaut to go up into space.\n\nIvy league colleges didn’t regularly accept women until close to the 1970s. Yale became the first ivy league college to admit women in 1969. After that, many other ivy league college started to accept women but at a pretty slow rate. For example, Columbia University didn’t allow women until 1983.\n\nWhile there were previous female judges and lawyers, it was scarce to see a woman in the legal field until the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. In fact, Cornell University ran a study which confirmed that 90% of law firms refused to interview women who applied for placement in their firms. On top of this, most law schools wouldn’t admit women into their programs.\n\nThe FDA approved birth control during the 1960s; however, individual states could create their own laws when it came to the birth control pill. Many states didn’t allow doctors to give their patients the birth control pill for various reasons. One woman from Connecticut, Estelle Griswold, started to sell the contraception, and was arrested. Her case went to the Supreme Court, which upheld that married women could receive the birth control pill in 1965. During the 1970s, more states started to allow doctors to prescribe the medication. Even then, most doctors still demanded permission from a woman's husband before they would prescribe it. \n\nPrior to the 1970s, females serving on a jury was rare but not impossible. It did happen but it hardly ever occurred before the 1970s, especially once the 20th Century rolled around. Allowing women to serve in a jury became a law for individual states to decide. Many states didn’t allow women to sit on a jury until 1973 when all 50 states made it a requirement that females were allowed to participate.\n\nWomen weren't allowed to sit on the Supreme Court. It wasn’t until right after the 1970s, in 1981, when Sandra Day O’Connor received a seat for the Supreme Court. She held this position until 2006 when she retired. Other than O’Connor, three other women have served on the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan.\n\nDuring the 1970s, many states had laws against living with your significant other before marriage. It wasn’t until 2013 when all 50 states adopted the law to allow couples to live together without getting married first.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 worked to end workplace discrimination; however, it continued in several states and among hundreds of professions. Even though employers couldn’t legally reject women for jobs because of their gender, they could reject women for other reasons. Some employers would skip applications by women while others would come up with a different reason for not hiring them.\n\nJust like women couldn’t get a credit card without their husband’s signature, they couldn’t open a bank account without their husband’s permission. One of the reasons was because people believed they wouldn’t be able to handle the financial part. It wasn't until the late 70's that women actually having their own bank account became more acceptable. \n\n\nThere are people on here old enough to remember this. I'm not talking about two hundred years ago. I'm talking about In the lifetime of your grandmother and maybe even your mother. \n\nAnd the courts, yes, were definitely skewed against women obtaining custody of their own children. And with good reason. If she had no education and she couldn't hold down a job due to discrimination, or one with a living wage, it was almost impossible for a woman to support her children so of course the courts gave custody more often to the father.","body_html":"<p>You're talking the 16-17 hundreds. I'm talking about the 1920's through the 1970's.</p>\n<p>Legally, banks could deny women credit cards until 1974 with the passing of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The applications from women who tried to take a credit card out under their name received the stamp of “denied” or told them to get their husband’s’ signature on the form. If the woman wasn’t married, the bank would still request she bring a male, such as her father or brother, who could co-sign the application.</p>\n<p>Before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, women could lose their jobs because of a pregnancy. The passing of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act stated that women could not get fired because they became pregnant as this was an act of discrimination against women. Of course, this didn’t mean that women would receive payment for the time they missed due to their pregnancy. It also didn’t say that they couldn’t be fired for “other reasons” once they became pregnant. The act just meant that the reason for firing a woman could not be because of her pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Women were not allowed to attend a military academy because men believed that women would not be able to make through the academy. This idea changed when West Point admitted its first female students in 1976. Four years later, Andrea Hollen and 61 other females became the first women to graduate from a military academy on May 28, 1980. However, women couldn’t fight in combat until 2013, per a 1994 ban.</p>\n<p>Women were not allowed to protect themselves from work place harassment. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission came up with a definition for sexual harassment and stated it created a hostile work environment. Six years later, the United States Supreme Court would agree with their ruling. 1986. Some of the people on this site are older than that.</p>\n<p>Women didn’t receive direct consultation about their health from doctors. A wife had to have her husband speak on her behalf for many reasons; one being women couldn’t understand what the doctors were saying.</p>\n<p>Wives finally started to receive some legal protection in the 1970s from their husbands. State courts began to realize that there was something called marital rape. However, very few states would do anything about any type of spousal rape accusations from a woman until the early 1990s with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. With this act, women became legally protected from any act of violence from their husband, including physical assault and rape. Before the action, many police departments around the United States believed any abuse from a husband towards his wife was a private family matter.</p>\n<p>Women were not legally allowed to divorce their husbands without giving the Courts a reason, that was acceptable to a male judge. Not until the No-Fault Divorce Act in 1969. This act allowed women to obtain a divorce easier as they no longer had to prove their partner’s fault when requesting a divorce. 1969. Husbands, on the other hand, were often granted a divorce for any reason at all.</p>\n<p>While some states had selected female judges, women weren’t typically able to sit in the at a regular rate in the United States until the 1970s when the majority of states allowed women to serve as judges.
