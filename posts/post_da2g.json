Banning users from a guild isn't inciting violence either.</p>\n<p>You haven't addressed all the other guilds that you banned, which you claim, without evidence, that they were inciting violence (which again, your definition of incitement  is stricter than our own Supreme Court and results in banning protected speech.)</p>\n<p>You say you going to focus on just the users in question, well then why don't you unban those other communities and just ban the offenders as well?</p>\n<p>It seems pretty clear you misrepresented your reasons for banning at least two guilds. All this talk of incitement of violence feels like the same gaslighting we hear about \"violent white supremacists\" from the media.</p>\n<p>You've shown bad judgment on these matters time and time again. And you keep repeating this pattern of making sweeping changes without getting community feedback, then having to partially walk thing back when the community flips out.</p>\n<p>I really don't see how this site can be trusted going forward, the damage has been done. My guess is that you guys started this site out believing in freedom of speech, but then saw what goes along with that - the seedy underbelly of free speech including all the nasty, negative things people say - then started to compromise your principles.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1628780505, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_15013", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#30409F", "created_utc": 1579118742, "description": "Log of administrative actions taken against guilds, and other important administrative transparency information.\n\nIndividual user bans are not logged here.\n\nFor discussion about Ruqqus, visit +ruqqus\n\nFor updates to ruqqus, visit +changelog", "description_html": "<p>Log of administrative actions taken against guilds, and other important administrative transparency information.</p>\n<p>Individual user bans are not logged here.</p>\n<p>For discussion about Ruqqus, visit <a href=\"/+Ruqqus\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/+Ruqqus/pic/profile\"/>+Ruqqus</a></p>\n<p>For updates to ruqqus, visit <a href=\"/+changelog\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/+changelog/pic/profile\"/>+changelog</a></p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_18", "id": "18", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": true, "is_siege_protected": true, "name": "RuqqusAdmin", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+RuqqusAdmin", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqusadmin/profile-1.png"}, "guild_id": "18", "herald_guild": null, "id": "15013", "is_archived": false, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+RuqqusAdmin/post/da2g/incels-and-mgtow-unban/15013", "post": {"author_name": "ruqqus", "award_count": 0, "body": "We spent most of the past week debating on whether or not to include +Incels and +MGTOW in yesterday's ban wave for promoting violence.
