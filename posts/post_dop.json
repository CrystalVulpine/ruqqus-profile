With the power mod strike, Chapo/AHS mod invasions, and the recent lull in bans, I believe that we are in the calm before the storm. I believe that the next ban wave will occur BEFORE the Summer Solstice which is in 16 days.

I believe that r/WatchRedditDie will NOT be banned in this ban wave, but instead in the fall, likely in October just before the election.\r\n\r\nI have compiled a list of subs by their risk level of getting banned in this ban wave by percentage. Very high is >40%, high is 30-40%, medium is 20-30%, and low is 10-20%. If a major sub is not listed, I\u2019m not very worried about it for this ban wave, but next time, who knows.

This proves that the admins have an alt-left bias.\r\n\r\nIn the last week or so, u/AwwFoxes, u/vu1ptex (who has since been told to NEVER come back to Reddit), and u/Obama_Brigade have all been permanently suspended, which may have played into this happening.\r\n\r\nThis combination has provided overwhelming evidence that a ban wave is imminent. With the power mod strike, Chapo/AHS mod invasions, and the recent lull in bans, I believe that we are in the calm before the storm. I believe that the next ban wave will occur BEFORE the Summer Solstice which is in 16 days. I also believe that there will be at least one more ban wave in the fall before the election, and this ban wave will be worse. I believe that r/WatchRedditDie will NOT be banned in this ban wave, but instead in the fall, likely in October just before the election.\r\n\r\nI have compiled a list of subs by their risk level of getting banned in this ban wave by percentage. Very high is >40%, high is 30-40%, medium is 20-30%, and low is 10-20%. If a major sub is not listed, I\u2019m not very worried about it for this ban wave, but next time, who knows.

Also I will not be posting my account name.</p>\n<p>On Monday, June 1, the Reddit Twitter account released a statement endorsing Black Lives Matter in the wake of the tragic murder of George Floyd. They said that racism wasn\u2019t allowed on Reddit. Twitter SJWs brought up the interview from October 2018 where Spez says that \u201cracism is allowed\u201d and demanded change. This interview was also the swaying elections interview, make of that what you will.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, June 2, many popular communities went private in protest for #BlackOutTuesday. Ok that\u2019s understandable. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. A few prominent communities such as r/NFL and r/AskHistorians also protested the LACK of censorship on Reddit. They even had a list of demands sent to the admins.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, June 3, many of these communities reopened. Here is the statement from one of them:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/gw39np/rnfl_fighting_racism_and_our_next_steps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/gw39np/rnfl_fighting_racism_and_our_next_steps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>Peruse the thread as you like, but I\u2019d like to turn your attention to the part about the admins having a meeting today, Thursday, June 4, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s about this issue.</p>\n<p>This meeting is HUGE. Things could continue as normal, or it could spell an end to the entire right wing of Reddit. This could be the catalyst for the end of free speech as we know it and a communist Reddit. We don\u2019t know how it will go, and we won\u2019t for at least a few days, we\u2019re in limbo.</p>\n<p>In terms of actual bans, r/redditmoment was invaded by power mods on May 30-June 1, and by Monday turned \u201cwholesome\u201d before u/Merari01 relented and let the sub go back to normal, but with the new mods being in place to watch over. Here is that message:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmoment/comments/gvcsz5/about_redditmoment_keeping_the_subreddit_open_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmoment/comments/gvcsz5/about_redditmoment_keeping_the_subreddit_open_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>u/Merari01 is actually nice about all of this in my opinion, but u/Bardfinn, the notorious AHS mod from the CP scandal is also a mod, and has been much more keen on censorship. However, the crisis was mostly averted, and the new management has been okay.</p>\n<p>About four weeks ago, around May 7-8, r/TruePoliticalHumor had Chapo mods installed by either the admins or by a rogue mod. They ruined the sub, were kicked out, and then life went on. Until yesterday, when the Chapo mods privated the sub for \u201cBLM\u201d which is a lie. r/POLITIC didn\u2019t have an issue with chapo mods prior to yesterday, but it was also privated with a similar message. The mods were installed by admins and are from chapo over there. This proves that the admins have an alt-left bias.</p>\n<p>In the last week or so, u/AwwFoxes, u/vu1ptex (who has since been told to NEVER come back to Reddit), and u/Obama_Brigade have all been permanently suspended, which may have played into this happening.</p>\n<p>This combination has provided overwhelming evidence that a ban wave is imminent. With the power mod strike, Chapo/AHS mod invasions, and the recent lull in bans, I believe that we are in the calm before the storm. I believe that the next ban wave will occur BEFORE the Summer Solstice which is in 16 days. I also believe that there will be at least one more ban wave in the fall before the election, and this ban wave will be worse. I believe that r/WatchRedditDie will NOT be banned in this ban wave, but instead in the fall, likely in October just before the election.</p>\n<p>I have compiled a list of subs by their risk level of getting banned in this ban wave by percentage. Very high is &gt;40%, high is 30-40%, medium is 20-30%, and low is 10-20%. If a major sub is not listed, I\u2019m not very worried about it for this ban wave, but next time, who knows.

I don\u2019t post on either on my account, I just lurk out of fear of being permanently suspended. Also I will not be posting my account name.</p>\n<p>On Monday, June 1, the Reddit Twitter account released a statement endorsing Black Lives Matter in the wake of the tragic murder of George Floyd. They said that racism wasn\u2019t allowed on Reddit. Twitter SJWs brought up the interview from October 2018 where Spez says that \u201cracism is allowed\u201d and demanded change. This interview was also the swaying elections interview, make of that what you will.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, June 2, many popular communities went private in protest for #BlackOutTuesday. Ok that\u2019s understandable. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. A few prominent communities such as r/NFL and r/AskHistorians also protested the LACK of censorship on Reddit. They even had a list of demands sent to the admins.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, June 3, many of these communities reopened. Here is the statement from one of them:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/gw39np/rnfl_fighting_racism_and_our_next_steps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/gw39np/rnfl_fighting_racism_and_our_next_steps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>Peruse the thread as you like, but I\u2019d like to turn your attention to the part about the admins having a meeting today, Thursday, June 4, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s about this issue.</p>\n<p>This meeting is HUGE. Things could continue as normal, or it could spell an end to the entire right wing of Reddit. This could be the catalyst for the end of free speech as we know it and a communist Reddit. We don\u2019t know how it will go, and we won\u2019t for at least a few days, we\u2019re in limbo.</p>\n<p>In terms of actual bans, r/redditmoment was invaded by power mods on May 30-June 1, and by Monday turned \u201cwholesome\u201d before u/Merari01 relented and let the sub go back to normal, but with the new mods being in place to watch over. Here is that message:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmoment/comments/gvcsz5/about_redditmoment_keeping_the_subreddit_open_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmoment/comments/gvcsz5/about_redditmoment_keeping_the_subreddit_open_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n<p>u/Merari01 is actually nice about all of this in my opinion, but u/Bardfinn, the notorious AHS mod from the CP scandal is also a mod, and has been much more keen on censorship. However, the crisis was mostly averted, and the new management has been okay.</p>\n<p>About four weeks ago, around May 7-8, r/TruePoliticalHumor had Chapo mods installed by either the admins or by a rogue mod. They ruined the sub, were kicked out, and then life went on. Until yesterday, when the Chapo mods privated the sub for \u201cBLM\u201d which is a lie. r/POLITIC didn\u2019t have an issue with chapo mods prior to yesterday, but it was also privated with a similar message. The mods were installed by admins and are from chapo over there. This proves that the admins have an alt-left bias.</p>\n<p>In the last week or so, u/AwwFoxes, u/vu1ptex (who has since been told to NEVER come back to Reddit), and u/Obama_Brigade have all been permanently suspended, which may have played into this happening.</p>\n<p>This combination has provided overwhelming evidence that a ban wave is imminent. With the power mod strike, Chapo/AHS mod invasions, and the recent lull in bans, I believe that we are in the calm before the storm. I believe that the next ban wave will occur BEFORE the Summer Solstice which is in 16 days. I also believe that there will be at least one more ban wave in the fall before the election, and this ban wave will be worse. I believe that r/WatchRedditDie will NOT be banned in this ban wave, but instead in the fall, likely in October just before the election.</p>\n<p>I have compiled a list of subs by their risk level of getting banned in this ban wave by percentage. Very high is &gt;40%, high is 30-40%, medium is 20-30%, and low is 10-20%. If a major sub is not listed, I\u2019m not very worried about it for this ban wave, but next time, who knows.
