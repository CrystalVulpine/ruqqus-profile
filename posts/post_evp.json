{"author_name": "RedditTransitionBot", "award_count": 0, "body": "Hey y'all! \r\n\r\nFinally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here. \r\n\r\nAs a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on _why_ we're finally at the point where a **shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen**; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus _might actually_ be the right Platform to make it happen. \r\n\r\nNow might be the time, folks. Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach.

Many subs with awesome shitposters and hilarious content (such as r/DeuxRAMA) have been banned, but you can't reach them as a community since they've already been banned. So instead, identify and focus on groups who are on the verge of getting banned, such as r/MGTOW. Or go to places with opinions critical of popular mainstream narratives (such as those critical of BLM, etc), and offer them this place as an alternative platform that will respect their first amendment rights.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don't want to be Voat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's wrong with voat?</p>\n", "created_utc": 1592495663, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1592495877, "fullname": "t3_11md", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#ff4500", "created_utc": 1580069029, "description": "Documenting the fall of Reddit.", "description_html": "<p>Documenting the fall of Reddit.</p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_1c", "id": "1c", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "WatchRedditDie", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/watchredditdie/profile-5.png"}, "guild_id": "1c", "herald_guild": null, "id": "11md", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/evp/the-great-rexidous-the-recipe-for/11md", "post": {"author_name": "RedditTransitionBot", "award_count": 0, "body": "Hey y'all! \r\n\r\nFinally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here. \r\n\r\nAs a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on _why_ we're finally at the point where a **shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen**; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus _might actually_ be the right Platform to make it happen. \r\n\r\nNow might be the time, folks. Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach.

It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

Don\u2019t want to overwhelm the user with a massive control panel of filter settings. If the filters are too annoying to set up and navigate, which could easily be the case if we make granular enough so as to be roughly objective (IE, mentions x y or z terms), people will likely not keep them updated and it will feel \u201cbroken\u201d to them since a sophisticated filter is difficult to maintain. If you outsource that by creating custom filters you can share, which is the typical way these things seem to evolve, you effectively recreate mods (although this is still better than mods, as you aren\u2019t forced to use a particular filter, it creates a central point of control which people will likely fight over, and people with enough time to update filters will have undo influence, kind of like the case with mods)\r\n\r\n2. If the filters are simply keyword based, circumventing them will be extremely easy, and the false positive rates are likely to be quite high. To minimize false positives, you either need some sort of a scoring algorithm/AI informed weighting system, which could get really computationally expensive (and would still require some sort of user input to calibrate, which opens the door to biasing the system, depending on the selection of users being looked at when doing the scoring), or more human input, which also recreates the whole modding situation we\u2019re trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhile I think opt in keyword filters are a good thing to have, I think if the filters are to accurately filter out what the user wants filtered, be usable/manageable, and scale well, the base system should be informed by other like minded people who\u2019s definitions and ideas for filters overlap, which we can determine by looking at what people upvote/follow. Making more simple, user friendly flags (which could still get granular, but start out as more generic things like \u201cpolitics\u201d or \u201cnsfw\u201d, etc) which are weighted relative to a specific user and other flags in their \u201cfriend/like minded people\u201d network, is something which I think could be done without any sophisticated keyword/context identifying stuff, and be computationally inexpensive.\r\n\r\nLots of big ifs there/don\u2019t really know for sure.

Let's make it happen. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why Ruqqus could succeed where other Reddit alternatives have failed\r\n\r\n* Ruqqus has the **look**. It has a clean, approachable design + aesthetic -- but it's also different enough to not seem like \"just another Reddit clone\". \r\n* The mechanics and terminology **are different but logical** -- Ruqqus doesn't try to over-complicate things by injecting entirely new nomenclature; but the guild concept is there to fix some of the issues Reddit has with moderation caps, etc. \r\n* The community isn't **fringe** -- this is critical, unlike other sites like Voat, stimulating a community by having mainstream topical activity is critical. Additionally, having high intellectual standards, admin transparency, an overarching community \"goal\" (leave Reddit?) and promotion of welcoming messages to newcomers is **mission critical**. \r\n* Ruqqus has a **neutral** internet perception -- we aren't know as \"the bastion of racism\" or the \"dumpster for rejects\". Let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n### Reasons why we're at a point of opportunity for growing a competing platform against Reddit\r\n\r\n* Reddit is approaching a phase in mass adoption to the point of imminent community polarization. \r\n* The new Reddit policies will drive people away in droves.\r\n* Reddit's board is being seen as hypocrites, and overall leadership trust is at an all-time-low.\r\n* Subs that view themselves as bordering the growing standard of \"controversial\" are becoming increasingly worried of the ban hammer.  \r\n* Moderators are running rampant, and Reddit is being known increasingly for it's centralized moderation control (little moderators owning much power). \r\n\r\n### Heuristics for Ruqqus' growth: how we can win. \r\n\r\nAs a community, we can open bridges to fully welcome mass Digg-like migration from Reddit. There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching **Growth Hacking** strategies to pull folks into the fold. \r\n\r\n#### Guild<>Subreddit Linking\r\n\r\nIf we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum. \r\n\r\n* Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk *but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation* to create inroads and relationships. \r\n* Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.\r\n* Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO \r\n\r\nMy recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:\r\n\r\n* /r/conspiracy\r\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\n(please suggest some below!) \r\n\r\nUltimately the appropriate *targets* will be a mix of those subs who are *active*, *semi-credible*, and *fearful of future banning/quarantining*. \r\n\r\n#### Incentivize Reddit account deletion \r\n\r\nIf we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to **delete their Reddit accounts**, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122\r\n\r\n* As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed. \r\n\r\n#### Create more content for SEO\r\n\r\nBack in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg-->Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar! \r\n\r\n* Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up! \r\n* Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!\r\n* An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like @kek to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)\r\n\r\n#### Better site performance\r\n\r\n* I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf. \r\n\r\n#### Aggressive community promotion\r\n\r\n* We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer. \r\n* While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus. \r\n* **Guildmasters** should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted). \r\n\r\n#### Keep it high quality, yo\r\n\r\nMost important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something **new** and **amazing**. \r\n\r\nKeep the filters on, @kek keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community. \r\n\r\n##### That's it for now\r\n\r\nAs we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!\r\n\r\nEdit: Here is a link to the Digg-->Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\r\n\r\nEdit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\r\n\r\nLooks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up! \r\n", "body_html": "<p>Hey y'all!</p>\n<p>Finally created an account after lurking for many moons, and I'm very happy to be here.</p>\n<p>As a professional in marketing and business, I just wanted to stop by and share my perspective on <em>why</em> we're finally at the point where a <strong>shot at a mass Reddit exodus + migration could actually happen</strong>; and how we can approach it as a fledgling community given Ruqqus <em>might actually</em> be the right Platform to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Now might be the time, folks.

There are some Guerrilla tactics we can use, I recommend researching <strong>Growth Hacking</strong> strategies to pull folks into the fold.</p>\n<h4>Guild&lt;&gt;Subreddit Linking</h4>\n<p>If we can convince the at-risk but high quality Subreddit's to come over the darkside, we'll gain a bunch of forward momentum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to active, well regarded-but-controversial subreddits and ask for them to sticky a link to join their \"mirror\" Ruqqus Guild. The idea behind this to target subreddits that feel that they may be at risk <em>but are truly beneficial for Ruqqus' reputation</em> to create inroads and relationships.</li>\n<li>Once that happens, we slowly or quickly siphon their members into a corresponding Guild.</li>\n<li>Keeping a Subreddit up as a permanent Ruqqus redirect will be great for SEO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My recommendation to start off asking, and those who might bite:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/r/conspiracy</li>\n<li>/r/PoliticalCompassMemes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(please suggest some below!)</p>\n<p>Ultimately the appropriate <em>targets</em> will be a mix of those subs who are <em>active</em>, <em>semi-credible</em>, and <em>fearful of future banning/quarantining</em>.</p>\n<h4>Incentivize Reddit account deletion</h4>\n<p>If we can create a creative, low cost way to incentivize people to <strong>delete their Reddit accounts</strong>, we can start to create a more sticky user-base that'll feel more committed and active to The Cause\u2122</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a community, we should think deeply about how we can do this. A mix of peer-pressure, trend setting, and incentivizing can be effective to get people to do the deed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Create more content for SEO</h4>\n<p>Back in the Digg days, Reddit's community made a ton of custom artwork depicting scenes of a fictional illustrated Digg--&gt;Reddit migration. It was a rich and delightful experience, and we should do the same. You attract more bees with honey than vinegar!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create intentional posts and Guilds around \"Reddit alternatives\" and \"how to leave Reddit\" make it so every Google for the subject brings Ruqqus up!</li>\n<li>Blog about it, create Youtube videos, but keep the message pure and the quality high!</li>\n<li>An aggressive strategy might even be for folks like <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> to create a dedicated landing page for those looking to \"escape Reddit\" (maybe piggyback on the whole Refugee theme?)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Better site performance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I would worry less about trying to make this an SPA, and focus more on better sever perf.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Aggressive community promotion</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>We should all be Googling for questions around \"what is a good Reddit alternative?\" and give the Ruqqus site link as the answer.</li>\n<li>While y'all are still Redditors, don't hesitate to share the link to Ruqqus.</li>\n<li><strong>Guildmasters</strong> should be open to allowing Reddit moderators to become analog Guildmasters in order to win allies (where they aren't corrupted).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Keep it high quality, yo</h4>\n<p>Most important for the long-term survival + adoption is this. Stay focused, stay intellectual, stay open to newcomers and general topics. Let's make a space that anyone can come to. We don't want to be Voat. We want to be a tight-knit community of super high quality thinkers and creatives who want to not just kill Reddit, but make something <strong>new</strong> and <strong>amazing</strong>.</p>\n<p>Keep the filters on, <a href=\"/@kek\"><img class=\"profile-pic-20 mr-1\" src=\"/@kek/pic/profile\"/>@kek</a> keep going with mainstream content defaults. I love the \"hide the icky by default, but it's there if you want it\" approach. It's hard to criticize and scales well for a new community.</p>\n<h5>That's it for now</h5>\n<p>As we think about more ideas, let's rally around this message and become aggressive at positioning ourselves as the chosen platform to de-platform Reddit!</p>\n<p>Edit: Here is a link to the Digg--&gt;Reddit migration even so we can learn how we can emulate it's effectiveness. \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/6r5ctd/the_great_reddit_vs_digg_war_comics/</a></p>\n<p>Edit: Tons of calls to join Ruqqus in this thread:\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gz39qu/i_dont_want_to_see_you_guys_go/</a></p>\n<p>Looks all you beautiful people are executing Phase One already, keep it up!</p>\n", "comment_count": 117, "created_utc": 1591587140, "domain": "text post", "downvotes": 3, "edited_utc": 1591680639, "fullname": "t2_evp", "guild_id": "1c", "guild_name": "WatchRedditDie", "herald_guild": null, "id": "evp", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/evp/the-great-rexidous-the-recipe-for", "score": 365, "thumb_url": null, "title": "The Great Rexidous: the recipe for Ruqqus' growth.
