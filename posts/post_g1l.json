There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.

There also tends to be time coordinated ban raids, not just all random.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the list of subs featured on r/reclassified today that were banned today with their reasons and times next to them:\r\n\r\nr/multiculturalcancer (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NorthwestFront (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalistsUnited (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/NationalTranshumanism (unmoderated, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/zoophiliasupport (violent content, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/brapbarn2 (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/BlackPeopleRight (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/The_Wall (being used for harassment, 12 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/diversity_is_racism (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/eugenics (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/killtheboomers (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/sorosforprison (harassing content, 21 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/antidiversity (harassing content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/snooicide (violent content, 22 hours ago)\r\n\r\nr/memeburnout (ban evasion, 1 day ago)\r\n\r\nr/LoveForJannies (ban evasion, 17 hours ago)\r\n\r\nThis proves two things:\r\n\r\n1. The admins are seriously gonna crackdown on all arguably harassing/violent content (some seem bad like r/killtheboomers but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a joke). A completely disproportionate amount of bans were for harassing/violent content when that usually is reserved for big subs. They aren\u2019t playing around. Small subs won\u2019t get away with it anymore. Small subs not only have to make it past being banned for ban evasion but now they have this fluid rule too.\r\n\r\n2. The admins do their ban raids at night. Nearly all of these bans were between 1 am and 7 am EDT. One possible reason for this is to reduce impact. If a person finds out their favorite sub was banned after waking up them and the community are less likely to be outraged than if they literally see it happen.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? Back to the two things I mentioned just now:\r\n\r\n1. Subs that have been accused of harassment or posting harassing content such as r/soyboys, r/Drama, r/DeuxRAMA, r/BruhFunny, r/Chodi, r/FemaleDatingStrategy, r/GenderCritical, r/PinkPillFeminism, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, and r/DarkHumorAndMemes are in danger, some deep danger, others not. Debatably racist content only amplifies this. This factor alone pulls in subs like r/TheHonkPill and r/WhiteBeauty. Violent content like what\u2019s seen on r/eyeblech and possibly even r/BestOfLiveLeak are also in danger. Many of these subs I feel I misjudged. If violent content is a major factor in the content policy change, eyeblech goes from the low category to high or very high easily.\r\n\r\n2. The big ban raid might occur overnight. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s r/ConsumeProduct (not mentioned in my first point but I will get to it in my third point), people will be very upset if it\u2019s banned, but far more upset at 4 pm than 4 am. I know coomer was banned in the early morning (a little after 8 am EST I believe) and this was probably because of this. Prepare to wake up to a bunch of subs gone in the morning. When you go to bed.\r\n\r\n3. Just because harassing and violent content may be the main points in the new content policy, doesn\u2019t mean that far right or free speech subs are safe. Just because they wanna attack arguably racist subs, arguably anti-semitic subs, TERF subs, and gore subs doesn\u2019t mean that subs like WRD are in the clear. They aren\u2019t. With the banning of three top mods there recently WRD and it\u2019s allies are also on their last legs. When FSW and ThomasJeffersonMod get permanently suspended, that will be the end of WRD, SRC, T_C, and possibly DIC and other subs such as r/thomasjefferson, r/AgainstSubredditBans, r/EverythingFoxes, and r/Awwaf.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m not sure if this will be all in one swoop like the September 30th ban wave. Spez did say that \u201cchanges were coming in the next few weeks\u201d. This could be a bunch of subs at once, or all spread out over multiple days, we just don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of news is that I know that u/ProEvilOperations was either permanently suspended or shadowbanned today. I\u2019m not sure if he was involved with you all but I always saw him on r/DeuxRAMA so I\u2019m not sure. Figured it might be important.\r\n\r\nAlso be warned, I believe that the main ban wave is extremely close. All of my predictions are only speculations, this could play out any way but I\u2019m fairly certain about certain bans.
