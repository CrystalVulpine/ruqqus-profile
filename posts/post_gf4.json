Hopefully it means more people will realize what's happening.\r\n\r\nWhen I first joined the site, I didn't know anything about the mods and admins. I got banned from practically every subreddit, but I was always told that it was just me and no one else had that problem. They convinced me that I was the problem, but wouldn't tell me what I was always doing wrong. What a blatant lie. Of course, I should have realized that the only people who could tell me anything were the few that *weren't* banned, which meant friends with the mods or even the admins.\r\n\r\nNow I know the truth. I think something like 90% of active users are banned, maybe even more. This is because the mods want to restrict the ability to post to a select handful of users, without saying that they are doing so.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many other people are being left in the dark about this. There's a lot for sure, and I lost count of the posts in WRD about people finally finding out about it. Hopefully this change makes people no longer expect to be welcome on the site without connections to powermods or admins. And then they'll stop being deceived and go elsewhere, like here.\r\n\r\nDon't be so sure that they'll announce it now though. They want to keep a good reputation and not look corrupt and biased, as proven by their obsession with making excuses to ban subreddits they don't like. Remember how many times they tried to ban WRD, but when they almost had it banned they were too afraid to actually click the \"ban this subreddit\" button in fear of a backlash, which could mean negative media attention and a decrease in profits. It will eventually happen for sure, but until they think they've made a believable enough excuse, they'll keep stopping just short of actually banning it. Likewise, they probably won't just say they're against free speech, even though they appear to be preparing to do so.","body_html":"<p>Good. Hopefully it means more people will realize what's happening.</p>\n<p>When I first joined the site, I didn't know anything about the mods and admins. I got banned from practically every subreddit, but I was always told that it was just me and no one else had that problem. They convinced me that I was the problem, but wouldn't tell me what I was always doing wrong. What a blatant lie. Of course, I should have realized that the only people who could tell me anything were the few that <em>weren't</em> banned, which meant friends with the mods or even the admins.</p>\n<p>Now I know the truth. I think something like 90% of active users are banned, maybe even more. This is because the mods want to restrict the ability to post to a select handful of users, without saying that they are doing so.</p>\n<p>I don't know how many other people are being left in the dark about this. There's a lot for sure, and I lost count of the posts in WRD about people finally finding out about it. Hopefully this change makes people no longer expect to be welcome on the site without connections to powermods or admins. And then they'll stop being deceived and go elsewhere, like here.</p>\n<p>Don't be so sure that they'll announce it now though. They want to keep a good reputation and not look corrupt and biased, as proven by their obsession with making excuses to ban subreddits they don't like. Remember how many times they tried to ban WRD, but when they almost had it banned they were too afraid to actually click the \"ban this subreddit\" button in fear of a backlash, which could mean negative media attention and a decrease in profits. It will eventually happen for sure, but until they think they've made a believable enough excuse, they'll keep stopping just short of actually banning it. Likewise, they probably won't just say they're against free speech, even though they appear to be preparing to do so.</p>\n","created_utc":1591991300,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_uxr","guild":{"banner_url":"/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png","color":"#ff4500","created_utc":1580069029,"description":"Documenting the fall of Reddit.","description_html":"<p>Documenting the fall of Reddit.</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_1c","id":"1c","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"WatchRedditDie","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/watchredditdie/profile-5.png"},"guild_id":"1c","herald_guild":null,"id":"uxr","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":1,"permalink":"/+WatchRedditDie/post/gf4/rwatchredditdies-automoderator-is-first-and-foremost/uxr","post":{"author_name":"SpezForgotSwartz","award_count":0,"body":"I am u/thomasjeffersonmod, aka SpezForgotSwartz, and I moderate r/WatchRedditDie.
