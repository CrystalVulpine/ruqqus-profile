The structure is in daylight; there are the admins using some powermods (the council) to further their goals, and those powermods trying to push their respective agendas to the admins. This fits well spez slipping his tongue on \"I don't see this as a kingdom, but...\", the structure is quite monarchical in nature.\r\n\r\nBased on \"The AHS members of The Council\", the powermods aren't themselves an organization, but a fragmented mess. Odds are the admins recruited them based on representation of the platform as a whole.\r\n\r\nIndividual powermods might however try to gather support with \"buddies\" for their causes, and I think AHS mods in the council might decide together what they're going to suggest the admins *before* talking with the admins. \r\n\r\nThe admins' want to see the_cabal gone is \"dissidence\". This is just a pretty word for \"they're making people distrust us\". It's damage control, to put it simply. \r\n\r\nThis explains also why AHS is trying to frame the_cabal as alt right: at the request of the admins, otherwise the ban backfires (Streisand Effect) and spawns even more distrust. This would be a favour AHS does towards the admins, and they'll most likely get a favour in exchange. Odds are they want something petty in exchange, such as \"pls gib us dat sub\". Here's where r/yiffinhell comes in, odds are AHS requested it (plus other small subs) in exchange of the favour.\r\n\r\nA council is something that *looks* powerful but it's actually quite powerless, since it doesn't have power to dictate jack shit. AHS lacks self-criticism to realize that however, so they might be drunk on power while the admins roll eyes.

It also shows how the admins and powermods structure themselves.</p>\n<p>There's no secret organization to speak of. The structure is in daylight; there are the admins using some powermods (the council) to further their goals, and those powermods trying to push their respective agendas to the admins. This fits well spez slipping his tongue on \"I don't see this as a kingdom, but...\", the structure is quite monarchical in nature.</p>\n<p>Based on \"The AHS members of The Council\", the powermods aren't themselves an organization, but a fragmented mess. Odds are the admins recruited them based on representation of the platform as a whole.</p>\n<p>Individual powermods might however try to gather support with \"buddies\" for their causes, and I think AHS mods in the council might decide together what they're going to suggest the admins <em>before</em> talking with the admins.</p>\n<p>The admins' want to see the_cabal gone is \"dissidence\". This is just a pretty word for \"they're making people distrust us\". It's damage control, to put it simply.</p>\n<p>This explains also why AHS is trying to frame the_cabal as alt right: at the request of the admins, otherwise the ban backfires (Streisand Effect) and spawns even more distrust. This would be a favour AHS does towards the admins, and they'll most likely get a favour in exchange. Odds are they want something petty in exchange, such as \"pls gib us dat sub\". Here's where r/yiffinhell comes in, odds are AHS requested it (plus other small subs) in exchange of the favour.</p>\n<p>A council is something that <em>looks</em> powerful but it's actually quite powerless, since it doesn't have power to dictate jack shit. AHS lacks self-criticism to realize that however, so they might be drunk on power while the admins roll eyes.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1592132373, "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_we4", "guild_id": "1c", "herald_guild": null, "id": "we4", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/h6v/two-major-announcements-bad-news-and/we4", "post_id": "h6v", "score": 2, "upvotes": 4, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["we4"], "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/h6v/two-major-announcements-bad-news-and/xlm", "post": {"author_name": "Dankmemer420", "award_count": 0, "body": "Ruqqus only post.\r\n\r\nN8 just posted this in r/The_Cabal:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Cabal/comments/h8fy6a/announcement_i_have_insider_information_that_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nBasically, what he is saying is that the default mods, the admins, and AHS all want to ban T_C when it hits 10000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nWhere is T_C at now?\r\n\r\n9881 subscribers. 119 to go.\r\n\r\nHe also says that some higher up members want to suspend participating accounts, and to unsubscribe and scrub your profiles.\r\n\r\nNow, is he bluffing?
