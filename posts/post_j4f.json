At least if you're the DefaultMods cabal and don't want your network to be exposed.","body_html":"<p>/u/allthevulptices: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eJCGgOh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/eJCGgOh.png</a></p>\n<p>There is nothing harassing in that post. Apparently exposing the DefaultMods cabal to the point where it is undeniable is a rather serious offense. Kind of like how /u/DefaultMods was also banned for exposing a picture of AEO removing stuff wrongly (no wonder they don't want public mod logs!). Even though it's stated nowhere in the rules. This cabal is <em>real</em>, and they are doing everything they can do cover up its existence.</p>\n<p>The admins already shadowbanned the account <em>and</em> removed every single post I made on it. Because I clearly demonstrated how a powermod has communication with them and that they use it to collude with each other, including on banning or taking over subs. I bet that same mod got me suspended. This was a weird suspension though. Usually the message comes from /r/<a href=\"https://reddit.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reddit.com</a>, but this time it came from /u/reddit and can't be replied to. I'm surprised they didn't just change the password again.</p>\n<p>This message also hinted that they think /r/The_Cabal is dedicated to harassment, which lines up with the recent message sent to WRD and Bardfinn &amp; SkynetJusticeWarri0r's comments about them being \"white supremacist\" subs. This seems to indicate that they are going to ban them.</p>\n<p>Here is the content of that post which is apparently so horrific:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was made private, and the whole mod team was removed and replaced. They plan to only allow furries to become mods there and permaban anyone who criticizes furries, so I suspected it was CorvusCalvaria aka KaaraRaven aka allthefoxes who was behind it. The admins did not like the sub either and it probably would've been banned otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was right.
