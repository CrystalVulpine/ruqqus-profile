On forums, you'd start to recognize people, perhaps by their profile-image, or forum signature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As soon as Trump won, the once rational and respectable people who upheld free speech realized that the only way to have a purpose in life, was to dedicate themselves to winning a propaganda war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wasn't politically active in the 2016 election, and mostly ignored the whole thing.  I knew people REALLY hated Trump for some reason, but mostly found \"lol, look at latest Drumf tweet\" to be super annoying.  It wasn't until the mass-censorship was rolled out in 2020 around the corona-virus, and then the riots that I actually decided to pay any attention to Trump and realized he's perhaps flawed but actually doing a decent job, much better than most politicians.  <strong>It didn't take me long to discover that the mass-censorship apparatus was created in response to Trump winning in 2016 and people being very butt-hurt, that they planned ahead to launch it in 2020 against Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The fact that the censorship was rolled out around the corna-virus was merely because it was a perfect excuse or cover to roll it out.  The intended target was always Trump.   Their abuse of this censorship and control of information <strong>killed many thousands of people, and cost trillions in economic damage.</strong>  Now we have riots, also fueled by the same thing.  I hate being involved in politics, and do my best to avoid it (currently failing), but it's hard for me to look around and see something that severely broken and just say \"this is fine.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that the only way to have a purpose in life, was to dedicate themselves to winning a propaganda war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may be a little late to respond for the 2020 election, but I firmly believe there will be a push-back.  New platforms like Ruqqus (and one I'm working on) will take the place of platforms that abused their power.  There's a moral incentive to rescue free speech.  There's also a financial incentive to scoop up traffic from people frustrated with mainstream platforms.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1593019329, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_18hh", "guild": {"banner_url": "/assets/images/guilds/default-guild-banner.png", "color": "#ff4500", "created_utc": 1580069029, "description": "Documenting the fall of Reddit.", "description_html": "<p>Documenting the fall of Reddit.</p>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_1c", "id": "1c", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "WatchRedditDie", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/watchredditdie/profile-5.png"}, "guild_id": "1c", "herald_guild": null, "id": "18hh", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent": {"author_name": "happypillows", "award_count": 0, "body": "I think the devolution of public discord started when the original concept of the message board was forgotten.
