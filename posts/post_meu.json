Socially, he is *extremely* progressive.\r\n\r\nI didn't put the Libertarian candidate because not enough is known about her yet. But you can see how even in the US politics gravitates towards auth-center, with a clear aversion to the Libertarian Right quadrant.", "body_html": "<p><a href=\"https://politicalcompass.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">politicalcompass.org</a> tends to put <em>everyone</em> in the authoritarian right quadrant, even socialists. It claims that Donald Trump is as auth as Hitler and is a fringe right winger. It will say leftists are still very right wing. And more authoritarian politicians are often ranked as less auth than others.</p>\n<p>The problem for the left/right axis is a confusion of what the terms mean. While the website says otherwise, it and a lot of people tend to immediately think of corporatism when they hear \"right\". However, right is supposed to mean lassiez-faire free markets. The truth is, corporations align to neither side, instead favoring what would benefit them the most, or \"crony capitalism\" which tends to be more in the center. For example, they would hate having to give up a lot of ownership to unions, but would love it if the government provided people with insurance and healthcare so they wouldn't have to. Megacorporations also like higher taxes and more regulations, because it makes things more difficult for their smaller competitors, and increases the chances of them getting more funding and power from the government, which they have heavy ties with and was probably their means for becoming so large in the first place.</p>\n<p>So, Joe Biden, a complete puppet for the deep state and major corporations who can barely remember what year it is anymore, is slightly left of center. He serves the interests of megacorps and elite politicians and intellectuals (the deep state), and would pass anything that benefits them, whether that be right or left. Socialism is not good for them, but neither is the free market because they want the economy to be controlled in their favor. He is also very authoritarian, like most of his Democratic Party he is very intolerant of ideas which differ from his own and calls for forcing social media to censor certain content. He also wants to ban guns and drugs, and has a history of racism. He's your classic \"give handouts to black people so they vote for us and shut up\" Democrat (he and others have since found that the same strategy works on people of all kinds, and that the more dependent they are on the government the more excuses they have to take away their rights). As for his social views, he's fairly progressive.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump, if you can see past the excessive ranting about him in the mainstream media, is similar enough to Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. The main difference is that he is not connected to the deep state, instead seeking to abuse his power mostly for himself. He also supports his own ring of people and corporations, which are less elite than those that generally occupy the interests of Washington. As such, he favors slightly less regulation to cater to them, knowing that the \"swamp\" as he calls it is hurting them immensely, but will still manipulate the economy in their favor or fund them when given the chance. He's also flirted with the idea of raising the minimum wage before. So he would be moderately right leaning. He has authoritarian tendencies, but it's mostly because he's full of himself; he at least supports most individual rights and free speech unless it's something that particularly triggers him, so he's not quite as auth as Biden or Hillary. He's also not nearly as conservative as he seems, probably more of a social centrist.</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders is not really tied up in any agenda, unlike most politicians these days. But he has absolutely no <em>clue</em> what he's talking about. He's not a complete socialist, more of a Social Democrat, but his collectivist ideas would tank the economy and remove choice and competition for a government controlled monopoly. That's definitely not a good thing, especially since governments have an even worse reputation than companies. He's also expressed support of socialism and completely publicly owned production, and the communist USSR and Cuba. So he's in the middle of the left side, in between socialism and today's mainstream Democrats. As he doesn't have much of an agenda and isn't as heavy on censorship as the others, he's less authoritarian, but still favors the collective over the individual in some circumstances, so he'd fall in the center. His social views are very progressive.</p>\n<p>Howie Hawkins is basically a more extreme version of Bernie Sanders. He's the nomination for both the Green and Socialist parties, and is pro-socialism and for complete control of the economy. He is a big collectivist so his concern for individual rights is questionable, but like Sanders he doesn't have much of an agenda. Socially, he is <em>extremely</em> progressive.</p>\n<p>I didn't put the Libertarian candidate because not enough is known about her yet.
