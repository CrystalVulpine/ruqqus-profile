This includes u/Elvis_Interstellar and u/Fun_Builder, who both were huge contributors in r/reclassified. Elvis was the one who had the ban list. I think this means that there are no non-powermods on r/reclassified but I\u2019m not sure. FSW and TJM are both fine.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the announcement from Spez if you hadn\u2019t seen it:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\r\n\r\nNotice how he specifically says that bullying the majority (white people) is allowed.

Some were completely unsurprising such as r/ConsumeProduct, r/imgoingtohellforthis2, r/TheHonkPill, and r/ClericalFascism, but others were very surprising to me, let\u2019s check them out:\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT: This may have been the most surprising of all. I put this in the no danger category because of the fact that they were LGBT and the sub never seemed that far right and rarely ended up on AHS while TERF subs and r/LGBDropTheT are LOATHED by AHS. To ban this was very surprising.\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical: GC was never the worst of the TERF subs, not even close. FDS and PPF are way worse. I think GC was only banned because of the fact that they\u2019re infamous, even off Reddit. The same can be said for the two below.\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald: It was extremely petty to ban T_D now AND ban all links to thedonald.win. Reddit is only doing this for their IPO and to say \u201cLook alt left media, we aren\u2019t racist!\u201d because T_D\u2019s last post was May 28 and the last one before that was March 17.\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse: The only reason why CTH was banned was because T_D got banned. They needed a leftist sub that people outside of Reddit knew about (not r/FULLCOMMUNISM, r/MoreTankieChapo, or r/PresidentialRaceMemes, two of which have been actioned on in the past, via quarantine and mod purge) to ban so people wouldn\u2019t think they were biased.\r\n\r\nr/BigChungus: Ok, what the fuck happened here?\r\n\r\nSome subs I\u2019m surprised survived include:\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor: Considering that now both r/average_redditor and r/bruhfunny are banned they are very lucky.\r\n\r\nr/Chodi: AHS bitched and bitched about them for months but here they are.\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT: People keep saying r/rightwingLGBT was anti-trans. This literally is anti-trans in the name.\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever: It\u2019s currently restricted and has been since May 9, but considering it was the direct spinoff of r/DarkHumorAndMemes (which was banned) with less rules I\u2019m shocked it outlived DHAM.\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad: Kinda feels like r/TheHonkPill now tbh. Pretty much all of the other subs like it like r/smuggies were banned.\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes: Eh I can see why PCM wasn\u2019t banned, I even put it at low risk, but don\u2019t be surprised if it goes soon.\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie: Not exclusively WRD, but the fact that NONE of the anti-censorship subs got banned is shocking to me. Probably saving it for the fall but who knows.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point: I don\u2019t think this is over. Nope. I think Spez said in the announcement that this wouldn\u2019t be the last ban wave like this, and that more will be in the near future, however I\u2019m not sure. If this isn\u2019t over, all of the subs that I\u2019m surprised didn\u2019t get banned are among those in deep danger.\r\n\r\nTimeline for a second wave is anywhere from tomorrow to the end of July. Probably between June 30 and July 15.\r\n\r\nIn terms of another ban wave, I believe that we have at least one, maybe two left before the election. If it\u2019s one wave, expect it in mid September to mid October. If it\u2019s two waves, expect them in mid August to early September and mid/late October. I could also see another one happening in December if they have only one ban wave.\r\n\r\nThe next ban waves won\u2019t be as severe unless the content policy changes again but I honestly wouldn\u2019t expect that for a while, unless another major world event happens.\r\n\r\nWhen the time is right. I will be posting my ban risk percentage chart depending on if there\u2019s one or two ban waves. A lot of subs will move up the list regardless (assuming they survive this ban wave), some subs I know will be in greater danger are PCM, r/GodWeeps, r/IncelsWithoutHate, pretty much all of the in action subs listed, and for the first time subs like r/unpopularopinion, r/TrueOffMyChest, and r/ActualPublicFreakouts will show up at the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\nThe ban wave news will continue until I am certain the ban wave is over just as an FYI, and even then there will probably be weekly updates until a new ban wave hits.\r\nHere is the list for today:\r\n\r\nVery High:\r\n\r\nr/ConsumeProduct*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/averageredditor*\r\n\r\nr/ClericalFascism*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/smuggies*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/FellowRetrievers*\r\n\r\nr/DebateAltRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLawEnforcement*\r\n\r\nr/Shortcells*\u2020 -BANNED 6/26/20\r\n\r\nr/BruhFunny*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/ShitNeoconsSay*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BrapBarn*\u2020 -BANNED 6/8/20\r\n\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\nr/soyboys*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/imgoingtohellforthis2*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AltRightChristian*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/SargonOfAkkad*\r\n\r\nr/The_Cabal*\r\n\r\nr/subredditcancer* -CLOSED 2/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeuxRAMA*\u2020 -BANNED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/Thank_China* -RESTRICTED 5/13/20\r\n\r\nr/edgiestmemesever* -RESTRICTED 5/9/20\r\n\r\nr/LoveForLandlords*\r\n\r\nr/Chodi*\r\n\r\nr/TheHonkPill*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/LockdownSkepticism*\r\n\r\nr/Plandemic*\r\n\r\nr/topnotchshitposting*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/cleanlivingkings*\r\n\r\nr/LGBDropTheT*\r\n\r\nr/Wuhan_Flu*\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n\r\nr/The_Donald*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/The_Congress* -CLOSED 6/10/20\r\n\r\nr/WeekendGunnit* -CLOSED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DrainTheSwamp*\r\n\r\nr/itsafetish* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WatchRedditDie*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW*\r\n\r\nr/AdminCrickets*\r\n\r\nr/PinkPillFeminism* -PRIVATED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AgainstSubredditBans*\r\n\r\nr/ITears*\r\n\r\nr/yiffinhell*\u2020 -RUINED 6/12/20\r\n\r\nr/redditownsreddit*\r\n\r\nr/TheNewRight*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/AZNIdentity*\r\n\r\nr/PresidentialRaceMemes*\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n\r\nr/TheRedPill\r\n\r\nr/IncelsWithoutHate*\r\n\r\nr/DarkHumorAndMemes*\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/DeclineIntoCensorship*\r\n\r\nr/MLBStreams*\r\n\r\nr/eyeblech*\r\n\r\nr/badunitedkingdom\r\n\r\nr/FemaleDatingStrategy\r\n\r\nr/GenderCritical\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/TruFemcels* -PRIVATED 6/28/20\r\n\r\nr/FULLCOMMUNISM\r\n\r\nr/HiddenChangelog*\r\n\r\nr/MurderedByAdmins*\r\n\r\nr/MGTOW2*\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalCompassMemes\r\n\r\nr/Offensivememesboi*\r\n\r\nr/thomasjefferson*\r\n\r\nr/Drama\r\n\r\nr/redditmoment\r\n\r\nr/Terfisaslur\r\n\r\nr/undelete\r\n\r\nr/NoLockedThreads\r\n\r\nr/HiddenPolicy*\r\n\r\nr/WorstOfModeration*\r\n\r\nr/ModsBeingDicks*\r\n\r\nr/RedditCensors*\r\n\r\nr/TrueLesbians\r\n\r\nr/China_Flu\r\n\r\nNot in danger, for now, however, some of these subs may not see 2021, these subs all have less than a 10% chance of being banned in this wave:\r\n\r\nr/SocialJusticeInAction\r\n\r\nr/WikipediaInAction\r\n\r\nr/TumblrInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction\r\n\r\nr/KotakuInAction2\r\n\r\nr/CringeTopia\r\n\r\nr/NoahGetTheBoat\r\n\r\nr/Shuffles_Deck\r\n\r\nr/FreeSpeech\r\n\r\nr/BestOfLiveLeak\r\n\r\nr/ChapoTrapHouse\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/MoreTankieChapo\r\n\r\nr/banned\r\n\r\nr/worldpolitics\r\n\r\nr/EverythingFoxes -CLOSED 6/2/20\r\n\r\nr/awwaf -CLOSED 4/20/20\r\n\r\nr/conspiracy\r\n\r\nr/Conservative\r\n\r\nr/ShitPoliticsSays\r\n\r\nr/anarcho_capitalism\r\n\r\nr/4chan\r\n\r\nr/okbuddyretard\r\n\r\nr/metacanada\r\n\r\nr/MensRights\r\n\r\nr/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\r\n\r\nr/PussyPassDenied\r\n\r\nr/PussyPass\r\n\r\nr/rightwingLGBT\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/WGTOW\r\n\r\nr/PoliticalHorrorStory\r\n\r\nr/Trump\r\n\r\nr/Walkaway\r\n\r\nr/WhiteBeauty\u2020 -BANNED 6/29/20\r\n\r\nr/BeatMeatToIt\r\n\r\nr/AgainstKarmaWhores\r\n\r\nr/PewdiepieSubmissions\r\n\r\nr/EnoughCommieSpam\r\n\r\nr/Enough_AOC_Spam\r\n\r\nr/drumpfisfinished\r\n\r\nr/FreeKarma4U\r\n\r\nr/GodWeeps\r\n\r\nSubs that won\u2019t get banned because they are useful to the admins:\r\n\r\nr/AgainstDegenerateSubs\r\n\r\nr/reclassified\r\n\r\nr/ShadowBan\r\n\r\nr/CommentRemovalChecker -RESTRICTED TO A BOT, RUNS SYNDICATED TO R/SHADOWBAN\r\n\r\nr/RedditAlternatives\r\n\r\n\u2020 = Banned (RIP)\r\n\r\nAsterisk = >50% chance of being banned by Election Day", "body_html": "<p>Ruqqus only.</p>\n<p>Well boys, it happened, it fucking happened today and I\u2019m gonna break it all down and discuss.</p>\n<p>This morning r/4chan reopened after going private yesterday.</p>\n<p>Then at I believe 12:58 PM EDT (somewhere between 12:58 and 1:01) the ban wave was LAUNCHED.
