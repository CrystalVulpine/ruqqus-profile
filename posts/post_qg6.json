They seem to think that we\u2019re destined to fail and have a \u201cthey\u2019re out of our jurisdiction\u201d attitude. Plus, god forbid if they got Ruqqus, Saidit, or the dot win sites shut down, that would be counterproductive for them as many would go back to Reddit.\r\n\r\nLay low for a little while and don\u2019t do anything to get AHS\u2019s attention.

When they are inevitably banned, we don\u2019t want them to come for us.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so terrible that these people are that evil to try and kick us while we\u2019re down, but remember that they have significantly less power on Discord as on Reddit. We could also try and find their Discord and report them for organizing a CP brigade. Once you find it report it to Discord and tell them to look back to around February 20 - March 10 and even after. I know that r/The_Europe got brigaded but not with CP (banned March 2), r/coomer, a_r, and possibly GRU (banned March 5), CP was posted on r/coomer on February 24, and some other subs where the brigades failed were WRD, r/ConsumeProduct, r/ITears, and r/shortcels (all around March 5-7). r/WikiInAction and r/weekendgunnit were also raided with CP around April-May.

Casualties included r/LoveForLawEnforcement and r/BlatantMisogyny.\r\n\r\nWith the ban of r/LoveForLawEnforcement, only two subs remain in the very high category, r/averageredditor and r/FellowRetrievers. Shoutout to the AR mods as good moderation likely saved them.\r\n\r\nIn this ban evasion ban wave, my third and final subreddit, r/Sliceofreddit, which was essentially r/Bestof and r/SubredditDrama but apolitical, private for 5 weeks and, completely inactive for 6 weeks. It was solely banned because I posted like 7 times Monday in r/reclassified. They knew they couldn\u2019t get my account for wrongthink (as I haven\u2019t even come close to breaking the content policy), so they did the only, extremely petty thing they could do, and banned it. It had 6 members and only one other person besides me who was an approved user. I guess anyone right of center can\u2019t make a subreddit anymore. No wrongthink allowed! And r/Sliceofreddit will be coming here once the site is stable again. It\u2019ll be like v/MeanwhileOnReddit on Voat.\r\n\r\nAlso I don\u2019t think this ban wave is over. There could be another wave of main subs banned. This could include: PCM, AR, WRD, r/Chodi, r/itsafetish, and r/LGBDropTheT. I would say the last three and AR would be the most likely to go. Expect this to happen before July ends.\r\n\r\nAlso on a more serious and sad note, AHS isn\u2019t stopping at banning subs off Reddit, they want to get their Discords banned too, Bardfinn has already infiltrated the Consume Product Discord and it appears that a false flagger suggested spamming AHS with CP. I also saw a post (since removed, it didn\u2019t take off though) about reporting the Discords of banned subs. However that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop at banned subs. They could go after the Ruqqus, WRD, DIC, or even Discords like the SPS one. It will be harder for them to find ones for subs like DHAM, smuggies, bruhfunny, and DeuxRAMA, plus, they didn\u2019t care as much about them anyways.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of Bardfinn recording what happened.\r\n\r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-qKXW2ud6a4\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to stop giving people the Discords to right wing subs because AHS may report them to the Discord admins.\r\n\r\nAHS could also directly attack Ruqqus, Saidit, or the dot win sites but that\u2019s much less likely to happen. They seem to think that we\u2019re destined to fail and have a \u201cthey\u2019re out of our jurisdiction\u201d attitude. Plus, god forbid if they got Ruqqus, Saidit, or the dot win sites shut down, that would be counterproductive for them as many would go back to Reddit.\r\n\r\nLay low for a little while and don\u2019t do anything to get AHS\u2019s attention. They seem focused on the TERF subs and r/Chodi right now. When they are inevitably banned, we don\u2019t want them to come for us.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so terrible that these people are that evil to try and kick us while we\u2019re down, but remember that they have significantly less power on Discord as on Reddit. We could also try and find their Discord and report them for organizing a CP brigade. Once you find it report it to Discord and tell them to look back to around February 20 - March 10 and even after. I know that r/The_Europe got brigaded but not with CP (banned March 2), r/coomer, a_r, and possibly GRU (banned March 5), CP was posted on r/coomer on February 24, and some other subs where the brigades failed were WRD, r/ConsumeProduct, r/ITears, and r/shortcels (all around March 5-7). r/WikiInAction and r/weekendgunnit were also raided with CP around April-May.

They knew they couldn\u2019t get my account for wrongthink (as I haven\u2019t even come close to breaking the content policy), so they did the only, extremely petty thing they could do, and banned it.

I also saw a post (since removed, it didn\u2019t take off though) about reporting the Discords of banned subs. However that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop at banned subs. They could go after the Ruqqus, WRD, DIC, or even Discords like the SPS one.

They seem to think that we\u2019re destined to fail and have a \u201cthey\u2019re out of our jurisdiction\u201d attitude. Plus, god forbid if they got Ruqqus, Saidit, or the dot win sites shut down, that would be counterproductive for them as many would go back to Reddit.\r\n\r\nLay low for a little while and don\u2019t do anything to get AHS\u2019s attention.

When they are inevitably banned, we don\u2019t want them to come for us.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so terrible that these people are that evil to try and kick us while we\u2019re down, but remember that they have significantly less power on Discord as on Reddit.

We could also try and find their Discord and report them for organizing a CP brigade. Once you find it report it to Discord and tell them to look back to around February 20 - March 10 and even after. I know that r/The_Europe got brigaded but not with CP (banned March 2), r/coomer, a_r, and possibly GRU (banned March 5), CP was posted on r/coomer on February 24, and some other subs where the brigades failed were WRD, r/ConsumeProduct, r/ITears, and r/shortcels (all around March 5-7). r/WikiInAction and r/weekendgunnit were also raided with CP around April-May.
