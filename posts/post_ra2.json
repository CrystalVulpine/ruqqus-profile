There\u2019s only one topic I have to talk about, and it\u2019s being \u201cbanned for ban evasion\u201d.</p>\n<p>No, I didn\u2019t get suspended from Reddit (although many have in a corrupt manner this week). I\u2019m talking about the ban evasion excuse the admits have.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s nearly certain that the admins use a bot to ban subs for ban evasion, I know they have a bot that automatically bans subs shadowbanned users create, which is fine. Unfortunately here, very often the bot gets it horribly wrong. Just by looking in r/reclassified I can see that in addition to my private, inactive, and irrelevant to anything sub getting banned on Tuesday, other people\u2019s subs about Paleolithic Europe and scary birds got banned, and I checked the people complaining\u2019s post histories, they had no participation in any political subs as far as I could tell.</p>\n<p>The excuses the admins use for these \u201cban evasion\u201d bans are pure shit to. All three of my subs were largely original and completely unbanned ideas that all got banned for ban evasion.</p>\n<p>I spent hours just prior to this copying the list of banned subs into my phone and completing it, adding on subs from every day from May 24 to July 2. I may put this up on a burner account soon or keep updating it and release it for August. There were three sections that filled out considerably, the \u201cno reason given\u201d one because of a bunch of linked subs that were basically all of the default, country, state, and city subs with an x on the end that all got banned, the \u201cpromoting hate\u201d section, for obvious reasons, and the \u201cban evasion\u201d section. It wasn\u2019t even 6 weeks and the list felt noticeably bigger there afterwards. I think this may mean that the admins are trying to stamp out any small right wing sub before it takes off so that they can\u2019t use the ban evasion excuse anymore.
