The damage may not be visible for several more years but it will occur if this is not addressed. It doesn't matter if you don't realize that it's a cabal, but it has already become that. Any group that is not an admin but has a direct influence on the admins is a cabal. Of course this will always occur to some degree, and there is nothing that can be done about that. But actually allowing certain non-admins into private admin discussions and giving them backdoors to the site's functioning and information is unacceptable.
