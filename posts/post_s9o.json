To hold onto an idea, but still be presented with something that may change your view. Even in fiction there can be a perspective that could have significant positive impact, or change world views. \"Dangerous\" ideas, whatever that maybe considered to the individual, can be heard and engaged. Also it will help prevent radicalism. For example, if someone has nothing but negative experiences with black people and begins to be racist, if every person after only attacks them and shuts them down, they will find the others and create echo chambers where they will spiral into cult like zealots. If the majority of these people were exposed to a wide range of ideas from a wide range of sources, most would change and never become some kind of skin head or something. There's danger in free speech as well, with propaganda and echo chambers, fake news, whatever, but for those that are trying to better themselves or society or the world or whatever, will want a place to discuss ideas that could potentially be \"wrong\" because they don't know, or they want to try and change minds, or a whole host of potential reasons. Those punk kids with a know it all attitude usually get humbled by life anyways, if they were engaged with actual intellectual debate, they will also learn to learn, learn they may be wrong about a position or opinion. Some people with certain mental issues could benefit from hearing ideas that might be considered taboo in most circumstances.</p>\n<p>Mainly I'd say it's because open discussion actually causes progress, if we aren't afraid to discuss opinions, we will be less afraid to compromise when we can understand where \"the other side\" is coming from. It will help everyone to see greater perspectives outside their bubbles in the world.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1593835050, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 1593835104, "fullname": "t3_1ub1", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/askruqqus/banner-4.png", "color": "#805AD5", "created_utc": 1581786138, "description": "Ask and answer questions.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 Posts must be questions.
