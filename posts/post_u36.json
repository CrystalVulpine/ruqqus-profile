Both sides generally want to politicize people to believe everything they say is right and everything the other guys say is wrong, but the reality is that people are mostly shades of gray. In my experience anyone who just automatically fully just believes what their political party tells them to believe is either dumb, has an agenda, or is lying to themselves.</p>\n<p>So at the end of the day, we're probably not going to change the two party system overnight, so I feel I'm best off voting with whoever has most or more of my personal interests and beliefs in their platform. Trying to find the person who checks every single belief box you have will be next to impossible, you might as well start your own political career at that point.</p>\n","created_utc":1593962012,"downvotes":0,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_22ef","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/politics/banner-3.png","color":"#30409F","created_utc":1583017571,"description":"News and discussions about politics","description_html":"<p>News and discussions about politics</p>\n","disallowbots":false,"fullname":"t4_3v","id":"3v","is_banned":false,"is_private":false,"is_restricted":false,"is_siege_protected":false,"name":"Politics","over_18":false,"permalink":"/+Politics","profile_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/politics/profile-2.png"},"guild_id":"3v","herald_guild":null,"id":"22ef","is_archived":true,"is_banned":false,"is_bot":false,"is_deleted":false,"is_distinguished":false,"is_heralded":false,"is_nsfl":false,"is_nsfw":false,"is_offensive":false,"level":3,"parent":{"author_name":"CtrlAltDeYEET","award_count":0,"body":"Could be, but I just can’t see myself voting for Biden or Trump.
