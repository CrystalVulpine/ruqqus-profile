The first option grants you immunity, so if someone uploads, for example, child pornography or libelous material, you are not liable for that content. The second grants you no such immunity, because the illegal content is either being implicitly or explicitly allowed by you in your role as publisher. This same paradigm exists outside the internet, and has been codified in law for over 100 years. The CDA and the DMCA made clear that these same regulations would apply whether your platform/publication is digital or physical.\r\n\r\nThe \"otherwise offensive\" clause was meant to address a scenario where, for example, the platforms TOS says \"You cannot upload pictures of sex\" and then someone uploads a picture of someone ramming a dildo in their own ass. The platform provider would be allowed to remove that, without giving up their immunity, thanks to that content being considered \"otherwise offensive\", despite not being explicitly named as disallowed content in the TOS. The *problem* is that now platform providers are using the \"otherwise offensive\" content clause to both actively moderate their platform and receive the benefits of being a platform.

It will not prevent a platform from deciding they do not want to host pornography, or not host neonazis, or whatever else they decide they dont want.

They would need to be upfront and point to specific rules that disallow the content when they decide to remove it. Otherwise, they cannot remove it. \r\n\r\nAnd if they want to arbitrarily decide? They can do that as well. They just do not get immunity under the law. So if someone uploads child pornography and they dont delete it? They will be charged for hosting child pornography. If someone posts something that is libelous and its not removed? They will be included in the civil suit. \r\n\r\nSo again, this has nothing to do with the platforms free speech rights, or giving the government power to decide what content lives and dies.

I'll bet you a dollar that if you look at the demographic maps of your city you'll find that they are very segregated. I'll also go so far as to say that if you look at the small businesses in the area you'll find that they're also pretty segregated as in staffed and owned by the same ethnicities. I'll also bet that if you do a little googling you could find that there's been a grooming gang in your area that went under the radar. \r\n\r\nHere's another prediction.

These forces operate identically no matter the scale (quantum to galactic), no matter the environment (open space, the center of a star, the core of a planet, the event horizon of a black hole, etc), and no matter the time (be it 0.1 second after the creation of the Universe or 10^100 years from now). These four fundamental forces are *utterly immutable*, *quantifiable*, and dictate how all higher order functions within the universe operate. They are objectively true. They are constants.\r\n\r\nFrom the restrictions put on matter by these forces come **the first interactions of higher energy states**\u2013quarks and electrons (we\u2019ll keep it simple and say those are it). Quarks combine to form protons and neutrons. The same types of quarks always form the same types of higher particles, because they\u2019re limited in their behavior to exactly what the four fundamental forces restrict them into being.\r\n\r\n**Electrons, protons, and neutrons come together to form atoms**. The arrangements of these particles dictate what type of atom is formed. The same type of atom is always formed by the same arrangement. You can\u2019t make hydrogen with two protons. You can\u2019t make rubidium with 9 protons, 8 neutrons, and 9 electrons. There\u2019re a whole mess of elements. They each have distinct properties. They\u2019re definable by those properties, which are unique to them.\r\n\r\n**Elements come together to form molecules.** There\u2019s a whole mess of molecules, too. All kinds of combinations. Thing is, elements are limited\u2013by their immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013in the ways they interact with one another to form molecules. FOOF can\u2019t exist *at all* below... 800\u00baC and 60 atmospheres. I think. Something like that. What we know as ice exists at 1 atm and below 0\u00baC. But there are other states of ice\u2013like ice IX, which can only exist at 2-4 atm and below -133\u00baC. Ice and ice IX have distinct properties, and they *always* have those properties *when subjected to the conditions which create them*. That\u2019s important for later.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where it gets more complex. Molecules, first of all, can get *super* [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin) in their own right. They even become so complicated that they get called \u201corganic.\u201d **Cells are made of various molecules**, and those different molecules move around and react to stimuli based on their specific properties\u2013which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013just as if they were operating independently. The molecules which make up cell walls, for instance, utilize their properties (we can call them \u2018electrochemical\u2019 at this scale) to ensure (for the cell) that materials which benefit it pass into it, and materials which don\u2019t benefit it pass out. Further, we\u2019re now on the scale where complex \u2018instructions\u2019 can be described. We use the metaphor of \u2018instructions\u2019 because of how precisely and mechanically the processes are carried out\u2013exactly the same way, every time (...a function of the four fundamental forces...). It\u2019s a metaphor because there\u2019s no thought or volition behind the act\u2013it\u2019s simply \u201cwhat always happens, electrochemically, when [x] molecule comes into contact with [y] molecule\u201d (as a function of... are you getting it? It all traces back to that absolute, immutable foundation).\r\n\r\nCells, in fact, can have extremely complex molecules. Molecules so complex that they begin to store immense amounts of data within them. This data is simply a specific (unique) arrangement of molecules\u2013in long, *long* chains\u2013which, when interacted with electrochemically, describe a specific (unique) set of chemical processes to reach a final result. I\u2019m talking, of course, about DNA. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four molecules (made of atoms, made of subatomic particles, made of quarks, defined in behavior by the four fundamental forces) which, in long, *long* tandem, *describe a vast series of chemical processes.* These chemical processes at the atomic level, reprised millions of times and carried to their conclusion, can result in a much larger, much more complex organism. **Like an organism with more than one cell.** Perhaps these cells have different functions, and perhaps these cells replicate into multiple cells with multiple functions. And even though the cells have different functions, they all have the same DNA within them, telling them exactly how to respond to different scenarios. Maybe this group of cells with the same DNA is really, *really* complex and grows into something big.  Like a fungus. Or a tree. Or a bird. Or a person.\r\n\r\nNext we move to **autonomic nervous responses**. Sounds like a bit of a jump from \u201ccomplex molecules\u201d to \u201chow a full animal reacts to a given stimulus,\u201d right? Nope! Exactly the same principle. Nerves, after all, are simply cells, which are made of molecules. All the types of nerves\u2013even a bunch of nerves in conjunction with one another\u2013are still cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, which have specific, immutable properties. When you shake salt onto a snail or slug, what happens? It curls up. Is it afraid of the salt? No; it can\u2019t comprehend the existence of emotion, nor could it overcome said emotion if it could. Does it simply not like the salt, whereas perhaps if it was introduced to the salt first it might come to understand and even love it? Nope. It curls up because of the chemical process that happens when the salt touches its skin, and this chemical process happens because of the order and arrangement of the salt molecules interacting with the order and arrangement of the slug molecules. These molecules interact in this way because of... that\u2019s right! their *specific, immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces*. It curls up because that\u2019s what the chemical responses tell the cells to do\u2013contract\u2013because *to do otherwise would be harmful.* That\u2019s important for later, too.\r\n\r\nNow, in animals there\u2019s something called \u2018instinct.\u2019 And I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush anymore\u2013** Instinct is genetic behavior, coded into a species from birth.** Genetic memory, in other words. Instinctual behaviors arise as a result of culture. In animals, since they have no \u201cculture,\u201d instincts come from the simple behaviors that keep the animal alive. A newborn calf, for example, can walk almost immediately after being born. Why? Because all calves with genetic arrangements that didn\u2019t allow them to do so probably died out a long time ago. Herds would not have been able to readily defend their immobile young from predators. Calves do not need to be taught by their mothers how to stand, walk, or run. They know how to do this *automatically* at birth\u2013instinctively. As another example, geneticists say there was once a bottleneck in the human gene pool. This roughly coincided with a cataclysmic environmental event seen in the geologic record. This event seems to have resulted in humans being able to out-endure virtually every other animal on the planet, in terms of the ability to keep moving. We may not be the strongest or the fastest animal, but we don\u2019t have to outrun our prey if we can simply outlast our prey. Humans can comfortably follow an animal until it collapses from exhaustion, at which point we\u2019re able to kill it with ease for its meat. This is because all the ancient humans who couldn\u2019t keep moving after that disaster died off, just like the cattle without the genes to let them walk immediately after being born. Now, humans also have the benefit of intelligence\u2013we can track animals and learn their location without seeing or smelling them. That physical endurance, coupled with intellectual prowess\u2013and the knowledge that anyone who didn\u2019t have it would have died off\u2013defined the first settlement-based human cultures.\r\n\r\nNOW WE REACH THE CONCLUSION! Yay. Here\u2019s where we draw **the distinction between culture and morality**. Cultures differ, both between and within species\u00a0(races). Culture, like instinct, is in many ways simply a higher-order chemical response to external stimuli. Scandinavians have a culture of fishing, rather than the Mediterranean culture of farming, because of the environment of their homelands. It\u2019s colder, rockier, the soil is different, etc. Their houses differ (because of the environment), their festivals differ, their tools and weapons differ, their artwork differs, etc. The things they prize over others, culturally, differ (fuel for warmth vs. marble for carving, etc. I\u2019m being reductive). The *reason* they prize these things is the same. We call instinct \u201cgenetically coded behavior.\u201d The behaviors are autonomous in nature, as they\u2019re the result of the chemical processes (which are the result of the atomic processes, which are a function of the four fundamental forces) which developed to ensure the individual\u2019s survival. Where culture is \u201c**a** collection of higher order behaviors which have *happened* to ensure survival\u201d, morality is \u201c**the** collection of higher order behaviors which guarantee the **highest chance** of survival.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe see, across cultures\u2013across *contact* of cultures\u2013and across time, a unified, codified set of behaviors, held by all of them. The *expression* of those behaviors might appear different (the steps to complete them might be different in operation), but the nature of the *result* of the behavior is the same, because it\u2019s predicated on the biological (chemical, atomic, fundamental) processes which led to the codification of the moral tenets.", "body_html": "<p>I\u2019ll give you the short version.</p>\n<p>The Universe is built upon <strong>four fundamental forces</strong>.

The arrangements of these particles dictate what type of atom is formed. The same type of atom is always formed by the same arrangement. You can\u2019t make hydrogen with two protons. You can\u2019t make rubidium with 9 protons, 8 neutrons, and 9 electrons. There\u2019re a whole mess of elements. They each have distinct properties. They\u2019re definable by those properties, which are unique to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Elements come together to form molecules.</strong> There\u2019s a whole mess of molecules, too. All kinds of combinations. Thing is, elements are limited\u2013by their immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013in the ways they interact with one another to form molecules. FOOF can\u2019t exist <em>at all</em> below... 800\u00baC and 60 atmospheres. I think. Something like that. What we know as ice exists at 1 atm and below 0\u00baC. But there are other states of ice\u2013like ice IX, which can only exist at 2-4 atm and below -133\u00baC. Ice and ice IX have distinct properties, and they <em>always</em> have those properties <em>when subjected to the conditions which create them</em>. That\u2019s important for later.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where it gets more complex. Molecules, first of all, can get <em>super</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complex</a> in their own right. They even become so complicated that they get called \u201corganic.\u201d <strong>Cells are made of various molecules</strong>, and those different molecules move around and react to stimuli based on their specific properties\u2013which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013just as if they were operating independently. The molecules which make up cell walls, for instance, utilize their properties (we can call them \u2018electrochemical\u2019 at this scale) to ensure (for the cell) that materials which benefit it pass into it, and materials which don\u2019t benefit it pass out. Further, we\u2019re now on the scale where complex \u2018instructions\u2019 can be described. We use the metaphor of \u2018instructions\u2019 because of how precisely and mechanically the processes are carried out\u2013exactly the same way, every time (...a function of the four fundamental forces...). It\u2019s a metaphor because there\u2019s no thought or volition behind the act\u2013it\u2019s simply \u201cwhat always happens, electrochemically, when [x] molecule comes into contact with [y] molecule\u201d (as a function of... are you getting it? It all traces back to that absolute, immutable foundation).</p>\n<p>Cells, in fact, can have extremely complex molecules. Molecules so complex that they begin to store immense amounts of data within them. This data is simply a specific (unique) arrangement of molecules\u2013in long, <em>long</em> chains\u2013which, when interacted with electrochemically, describe a specific (unique) set of chemical processes to reach a final result. I\u2019m talking, of course, about DNA. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four molecules (made of atoms, made of subatomic particles, made of quarks, defined in behavior by the four fundamental forces) which, in long, <em>long</em> tandem, <em>describe a vast series of chemical processes.</em> These chemical processes at the atomic level, reprised millions of times and carried to their conclusion, can result in a much larger, much more complex organism. <strong>Like an organism with more than one cell.</strong> Perhaps these cells have different functions, and perhaps these cells replicate into multiple cells with multiple functions. And even though the cells have different functions, they all have the same DNA within them, telling them exactly how to respond to different scenarios. Maybe this group of cells with the same DNA is really, <em>really</em> complex and grows into something big.  Like a fungus. Or a tree. Or a bird. Or a person.</p>\n<p>Next we move to <strong>autonomic nervous responses</strong>. Sounds like a bit of a jump from \u201ccomplex molecules\u201d to \u201chow a full animal reacts to a given stimulus,\u201d right? Nope! Exactly the same principle. Nerves, after all, are simply cells, which are made of molecules. All the types of nerves\u2013even a bunch of nerves in conjunction with one another\u2013are still cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, which have specific, immutable properties. When you shake salt onto a snail or slug, what happens? It curls up. Is it afraid of the salt? No; it can\u2019t comprehend the existence of emotion, nor could it overcome said emotion if it could. Does it simply not like the salt, whereas perhaps if it was introduced to the salt first it might come to understand and even love it? Nope. It curls up because of the chemical process that happens when the salt touches its skin, and this chemical process happens because of the order and arrangement of the salt molecules interacting with the order and arrangement of the slug molecules. These molecules interact in this way because of... that\u2019s right! their <em>specific, immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces</em>. It curls up because that\u2019s what the chemical responses tell the cells to do\u2013contract\u2013because <em>to do otherwise would be harmful.</em> That\u2019s important for later, too.</p>\n<p>Now, in animals there\u2019s something called \u2018instinct.\u2019 And I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush anymore\u2013** Instinct is genetic behavior, coded into a species from birth.** Genetic memory, in other words. Instinctual behaviors arise as a result of culture. In animals, since they have no \u201cculture,\u201d instincts come from the simple behaviors that keep the animal alive. A newborn calf, for example, can walk almost immediately after being born. Why? Because all calves with genetic arrangements that didn\u2019t allow them to do so probably died out a long time ago. Herds would not have been able to readily defend their immobile young from predators. Calves do not need to be taught by their mothers how to stand, walk, or run. They know how to do this <em>automatically</em> at birth\u2013instinctively. As another example, geneticists say there was once a bottleneck in the human gene pool. This roughly coincided with a cataclysmic environmental event seen in the geologic record. This event seems to have resulted in humans being able to out-endure virtually every other animal on the planet, in terms of the ability to keep moving. We may not be the strongest or the fastest animal, but we don\u2019t have to outrun our prey if we can simply outlast our prey. Humans can comfortably follow an animal until it collapses from exhaustion, at which point we\u2019re able to kill it with ease for its meat. This is because all the ancient humans who couldn\u2019t keep moving after that disaster died off, just like the cattle without the genes to let them walk immediately after being born. Now, humans also have the benefit of intelligence\u2013we can track animals and learn their location without seeing or smelling them. That physical endurance, coupled with intellectual prowess\u2013and the knowledge that anyone who didn\u2019t have it would have died off\u2013defined the first settlement-based human cultures.</p>\n<p>NOW WE REACH THE CONCLUSION! Yay. Here\u2019s where we draw <strong>the distinction between culture and morality</strong>. Cultures differ, both between and within species\u00a0(races). Culture, like instinct, is in many ways simply a higher-order chemical response to external stimuli. Scandinavians have a culture of fishing, rather than the Mediterranean culture of farming, because of the environment of their homelands. It\u2019s colder, rockier, the soil is different, etc. Their houses differ (because of the environment), their festivals differ, their tools and weapons differ, their artwork differs, etc. The things they prize over others, culturally, differ (fuel for warmth vs. marble for carving, etc. I\u2019m being reductive). The <em>reason</em> they prize these things is the same. We call instinct \u201cgenetically coded behavior.\u201d The behaviors are autonomous in nature, as they\u2019re the result of the chemical processes (which are the result of the atomic processes, which are a function of the four fundamental forces) which developed to ensure the individual\u2019s survival. Where culture is \u201c<strong>a</strong> collection of higher order behaviors which have <em>happened</em> to ensure survival\u201d, morality is \u201c<strong>the</strong> collection of higher order behaviors which guarantee the <strong>highest chance</strong> of survival.\u201d</p>\n<p>We see, across cultures\u2013across <em>contact</em> of cultures\u2013and across time, a unified, codified set of behaviors, held by all of them. The <em>expression</em> of those behaviors might appear different (the steps to complete them might be different in operation), but the nature of the <em>result</em> of the behavior is the same, because it\u2019s predicated on the biological (chemical, atomic, fundamental) processes which led to the codification of the moral tenets.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594094967, "downvotes": 5, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_2doy", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/censorship/banner-5.png", "color": "#603abb", "created_utc": 1582168207, "description": "Documenting and fighting censorship, anywhere, everywhere.\n\n[Click here to subscribe to our anti-censorship BitChute channel](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/PXMAWJOmBrWO/)\n\nFree Speech Content Hosting Options:\n\n* https://clouds.tf/\n\n* https://maga.host/\n\n* https://catbox.moe/\n\nArchive Tools: \n\n* https://archive.vn/\n* [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/)\n\nSave Twitter Videos:\n\n* https://www.savetweetvid.com/", "description_html": "<p>Documenting and fighting censorship, anywhere, everywhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/channel/PXMAWJOmBrWO/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe to our anti-censorship BitChute channel</a></p>\n<p>Free Speech Content Hosting Options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://clouds.tf/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://clouds.tf/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>https://maga.host/</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>https://catbox.moe/</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Archive Tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://archive.vn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.vn/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://archive.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Wayback Machine</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Save Twitter Videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.savetweetvid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.savetweetvid.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_25", "id": "25", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "Censorship", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+Censorship", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/censorship/profile-2.png"}, "guild_id": "25", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2doy", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent": {"author_name": "Windrunner", "award_count": 0, "body": "No one said otherwise, but you certainly implied it.

These forces operate identically no matter the scale (quantum to galactic), no matter the environment (open space, the center of a star, the core of a planet, the event horizon of a black hole, etc), and no matter the time (be it 0.1 second after the creation of the Universe or 10^100 years from now). These four fundamental forces are *utterly immutable*, *quantifiable*, and dictate how all higher order functions within the universe operate. They are objectively true. They are constants.\r\n\r\nFrom the restrictions put on matter by these forces come **the first interactions of higher energy states**\u2013quarks and electrons (we\u2019ll keep it simple and say those are it). Quarks combine to form protons and neutrons. The same types of quarks always form the same types of higher particles, because they\u2019re limited in their behavior to exactly what the four fundamental forces restrict them into being.\r\n\r\n**Electrons, protons, and neutrons come together to form atoms**. The arrangements of these particles dictate what type of atom is formed. The same type of atom is always formed by the same arrangement. You can\u2019t make hydrogen with two protons. You can\u2019t make rubidium with 9 protons, 8 neutrons, and 9 electrons. There\u2019re a whole mess of elements. They each have distinct properties. They\u2019re definable by those properties, which are unique to them.\r\n\r\n**Elements come together to form molecules.** There\u2019s a whole mess of molecules, too. All kinds of combinations. Thing is, elements are limited\u2013by their immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013in the ways they interact with one another to form molecules. FOOF can\u2019t exist *at all* below... 800\u00baC and 60 atmospheres. I think. Something like that. What we know as ice exists at 1 atm and below 0\u00baC. But there are other states of ice\u2013like ice IX, which can only exist at 2-4 atm and below -133\u00baC. Ice and ice IX have distinct properties, and they *always* have those properties *when subjected to the conditions which create them*. That\u2019s important for later.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where it gets more complex. Molecules, first of all, can get *super* [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin) in their own right. They even become so complicated that they get called \u201corganic.\u201d **Cells are made of various molecules**, and those different molecules move around and react to stimuli based on their specific properties\u2013which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013just as if they were operating independently. The molecules which make up cell walls, for instance, utilize their properties (we can call them \u2018electrochemical\u2019 at this scale) to ensure (for the cell) that materials which benefit it pass into it, and materials which don\u2019t benefit it pass out. Further, we\u2019re now on the scale where complex \u2018instructions\u2019 can be described. We use the metaphor of \u2018instructions\u2019 because of how precisely and mechanically the processes are carried out\u2013exactly the same way, every time (...a function of the four fundamental forces...). It\u2019s a metaphor because there\u2019s no thought or volition behind the act\u2013it\u2019s simply \u201cwhat always happens, electrochemically, when [x] molecule comes into contact with [y] molecule\u201d (as a function of... are you getting it? It all traces back to that absolute, immutable foundation).\r\n\r\nCells, in fact, can have extremely complex molecules. Molecules so complex that they begin to store immense amounts of data within them. This data is simply a specific (unique) arrangement of molecules\u2013in long, *long* chains\u2013which, when interacted with electrochemically, describe a specific (unique) set of chemical processes to reach a final result. I\u2019m talking, of course, about DNA. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four molecules (made of atoms, made of subatomic particles, made of quarks, defined in behavior by the four fundamental forces) which, in long, *long* tandem, *describe a vast series of chemical processes.* These chemical processes at the atomic level, reprised millions of times and carried to their conclusion, can result in a much larger, much more complex organism. **Like an organism with more than one cell.** Perhaps these cells have different functions, and perhaps these cells replicate into multiple cells with multiple functions. And even though the cells have different functions, they all have the same DNA within them, telling them exactly how to respond to different scenarios. Maybe this group of cells with the same DNA is really, *really* complex and grows into something big.  Like a fungus. Or a tree. Or a bird. Or a person.\r\n\r\nNext we move to **autonomic nervous responses**. Sounds like a bit of a jump from \u201ccomplex molecules\u201d to \u201chow a full animal reacts to a given stimulus,\u201d right? Nope! Exactly the same principle. Nerves, after all, are simply cells, which are made of molecules. All the types of nerves\u2013even a bunch of nerves in conjunction with one another\u2013are still cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, which have specific, immutable properties. When you shake salt onto a snail or slug, what happens? It curls up. Is it afraid of the salt? No; it can\u2019t comprehend the existence of emotion, nor could it overcome said emotion if it could. Does it simply not like the salt, whereas perhaps if it was introduced to the salt first it might come to understand and even love it? Nope. It curls up because of the chemical process that happens when the salt touches its skin, and this chemical process happens because of the order and arrangement of the salt molecules interacting with the order and arrangement of the slug molecules. These molecules interact in this way because of... that\u2019s right! their *specific, immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces*. It curls up because that\u2019s what the chemical responses tell the cells to do\u2013contract\u2013because *to do otherwise would be harmful.* That\u2019s important for later, too.\r\n\r\nNow, in animals there\u2019s something called \u2018instinct.\u2019 And I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush anymore\u2013** Instinct is genetic behavior, coded into a species from birth.** Genetic memory, in other words. Instinctual behaviors arise as a result of culture. In animals, since they have no \u201cculture,\u201d instincts come from the simple behaviors that keep the animal alive. A newborn calf, for example, can walk almost immediately after being born. Why? Because all calves with genetic arrangements that didn\u2019t allow them to do so probably died out a long time ago. Herds would not have been able to readily defend their immobile young from predators. Calves do not need to be taught by their mothers how to stand, walk, or run. They know how to do this *automatically* at birth\u2013instinctively. As another example, geneticists say there was once a bottleneck in the human gene pool. This roughly coincided with a cataclysmic environmental event seen in the geologic record. This event seems to have resulted in humans being able to out-endure virtually every other animal on the planet, in terms of the ability to keep moving. We may not be the strongest or the fastest animal, but we don\u2019t have to outrun our prey if we can simply outlast our prey. Humans can comfortably follow an animal until it collapses from exhaustion, at which point we\u2019re able to kill it with ease for its meat. This is because all the ancient humans who couldn\u2019t keep moving after that disaster died off, just like the cattle without the genes to let them walk immediately after being born. Now, humans also have the benefit of intelligence\u2013we can track animals and learn their location without seeing or smelling them. That physical endurance, coupled with intellectual prowess\u2013and the knowledge that anyone who didn\u2019t have it would have died off\u2013defined the first settlement-based human cultures.\r\n\r\nNOW WE REACH THE CONCLUSION! Yay. Here\u2019s where we draw **the distinction between culture and morality**. Cultures differ, both between and within species\u00a0(races). Culture, like instinct, is in many ways simply a higher-order chemical response to external stimuli. Scandinavians have a culture of fishing, rather than the Mediterranean culture of farming, because of the environment of their homelands. It\u2019s colder, rockier, the soil is different, etc. Their houses differ (because of the environment), their festivals differ, their tools and weapons differ, their artwork differs, etc. The things they prize over others, culturally, differ (fuel for warmth vs. marble for carving, etc. I\u2019m being reductive). The *reason* they prize these things is the same. We call instinct \u201cgenetically coded behavior.\u201d The behaviors are autonomous in nature, as they\u2019re the result of the chemical processes (which are the result of the atomic processes, which are a function of the four fundamental forces) which developed to ensure the individual\u2019s survival. Where culture is \u201c**a** collection of higher order behaviors which have *happened* to ensure survival\u201d, morality is \u201c**the** collection of higher order behaviors which guarantee the **highest chance** of survival.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe see, across cultures\u2013across *contact* of cultures\u2013and across time, a unified, codified set of behaviors, held by all of them. The *expression* of those behaviors might appear different (the steps to complete them might be different in operation), but the nature of the *result* of the behavior is the same, because it\u2019s predicated on the biological (chemical, atomic, fundamental) processes which led to the codification of the moral tenets.", "body_html": "<p>I\u2019ll give you the short version.</p>\n<p>The Universe is built upon <strong>four fundamental forces</strong>.

Where culture is \u201c<strong>a</strong> collection of higher order behaviors which have <em>happened</em> to ensure survival\u201d, morality is \u201c<strong>the</strong> collection of higher order behaviors which guarantee the <strong>highest chance</strong> of survival.\u201d</p>\n<p>We see, across cultures\u2013across <em>contact</em> of cultures\u2013and across time, a unified, codified set of behaviors, held by all of them. The <em>expression</em> of those behaviors might appear different (the steps to complete them might be different in operation), but the nature of the <em>result</em> of the behavior is the same, because it\u2019s predicated on the biological (chemical, atomic, fundamental) processes which led to the codification of the moral tenets.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594094967, "downvotes": 5, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_2doy", "guild_id": "25", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2doy", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent_comment_id": ["2d1f"], "permalink": "/+Censorship/post/v3r/absolutely-haunting-paragraph-from-the-atlantic/2doy", "post_id": "v3r", "score": -3, "upvotes": 2, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["2doy"], "permalink": "/+Censorship/post/v3r/absolutely-haunting-paragraph-from-the-atlantic/2ebt", "post": {"author_name": "Retrofire", "award_count": 0, "body": "Internet Speech Will Never Go Back to Normal ~ By Jack Goldsmith and Andrew Woods\r\n\r\n[Archived (non-monetized) Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200426210300/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/what-covid-revealed-about-internet/610549/)\r\n\r\nI found this in [Tucker Carlson's latest broadcast](https://youtu.be/sPrbGU0Wyh4?t=507).

These forces operate identically no matter the scale (quantum to galactic), no matter the environment (open space, the center of a star, the core of a planet, the event horizon of a black hole, etc), and no matter the time (be it 0.1 second after the creation of the Universe or 10^100 years from now). These four fundamental forces are *utterly immutable*, *quantifiable*, and dictate how all higher order functions within the universe operate. They are objectively true. They are constants.\r\n\r\nFrom the restrictions put on matter by these forces come **the first interactions of higher energy states**\u2013quarks and electrons (we\u2019ll keep it simple and say those are it). Quarks combine to form protons and neutrons. The same types of quarks always form the same types of higher particles, because they\u2019re limited in their behavior to exactly what the four fundamental forces restrict them into being.\r\n\r\n**Electrons, protons, and neutrons come together to form atoms**. The arrangements of these particles dictate what type of atom is formed. The same type of atom is always formed by the same arrangement. You can\u2019t make hydrogen with two protons. You can\u2019t make rubidium with 9 protons, 8 neutrons, and 9 electrons. There\u2019re a whole mess of elements. They each have distinct properties. They\u2019re definable by those properties, which are unique to them.\r\n\r\n**Elements come together to form molecules.** There\u2019s a whole mess of molecules, too. All kinds of combinations. Thing is, elements are limited\u2013by their immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013in the ways they interact with one another to form molecules. FOOF can\u2019t exist *at all* below... 800\u00baC and 60 atmospheres. I think. Something like that. What we know as ice exists at 1 atm and below 0\u00baC. But there are other states of ice\u2013like ice IX, which can only exist at 2-4 atm and below -133\u00baC. Ice and ice IX have distinct properties, and they *always* have those properties *when subjected to the conditions which create them*. That\u2019s important for later.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where it gets more complex. Molecules, first of all, can get *super* [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin) in their own right. They even become so complicated that they get called \u201corganic.\u201d **Cells are made of various molecules**, and those different molecules move around and react to stimuli based on their specific properties\u2013which are a function of the four fundamental forces\u2013just as if they were operating independently. The molecules which make up cell walls, for instance, utilize their properties (we can call them \u2018electrochemical\u2019 at this scale) to ensure (for the cell) that materials which benefit it pass into it, and materials which don\u2019t benefit it pass out. Further, we\u2019re now on the scale where complex \u2018instructions\u2019 can be described. We use the metaphor of \u2018instructions\u2019 because of how precisely and mechanically the processes are carried out\u2013exactly the same way, every time (...a function of the four fundamental forces...). It\u2019s a metaphor because there\u2019s no thought or volition behind the act\u2013it\u2019s simply \u201cwhat always happens, electrochemically, when [x] molecule comes into contact with [y] molecule\u201d (as a function of... are you getting it? It all traces back to that absolute, immutable foundation).\r\n\r\nCells, in fact, can have extremely complex molecules. Molecules so complex that they begin to store immense amounts of data within them. This data is simply a specific (unique) arrangement of molecules\u2013in long, *long* chains\u2013which, when interacted with electrochemically, describe a specific (unique) set of chemical processes to reach a final result. I\u2019m talking, of course, about DNA. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four molecules (made of atoms, made of subatomic particles, made of quarks, defined in behavior by the four fundamental forces) which, in long, *long* tandem, *describe a vast series of chemical processes.* These chemical processes at the atomic level, reprised millions of times and carried to their conclusion, can result in a much larger, much more complex organism. **Like an organism with more than one cell.** Perhaps these cells have different functions, and perhaps these cells replicate into multiple cells with multiple functions. And even though the cells have different functions, they all have the same DNA within them, telling them exactly how to respond to different scenarios. Maybe this group of cells with the same DNA is really, *really* complex and grows into something big.  Like a fungus. Or a tree. Or a bird. Or a person.\r\n\r\nNext we move to **autonomic nervous responses**. Sounds like a bit of a jump from \u201ccomplex molecules\u201d to \u201chow a full animal reacts to a given stimulus,\u201d right? Nope! Exactly the same principle. Nerves, after all, are simply cells, which are made of molecules. All the types of nerves\u2013even a bunch of nerves in conjunction with one another\u2013are still cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, which have specific, immutable properties. When you shake salt onto a snail or slug, what happens? It curls up. Is it afraid of the salt? No; it can\u2019t comprehend the existence of emotion, nor could it overcome said emotion if it could. Does it simply not like the salt, whereas perhaps if it was introduced to the salt first it might come to understand and even love it? Nope. It curls up because of the chemical process that happens when the salt touches its skin, and this chemical process happens because of the order and arrangement of the salt molecules interacting with the order and arrangement of the slug molecules. These molecules interact in this way because of... that\u2019s right! their *specific, immutable properties, which are a function of the four fundamental forces*. It curls up because that\u2019s what the chemical responses tell the cells to do\u2013contract\u2013because *to do otherwise would be harmful.* That\u2019s important for later, too.\r\n\r\nNow, in animals there\u2019s something called \u2018instinct.\u2019 And I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush anymore\u2013** Instinct is genetic behavior, coded into a species from birth.** Genetic memory, in other words. Instinctual behaviors arise as a result of culture. In animals, since they have no \u201cculture,\u201d instincts come from the simple behaviors that keep the animal alive. A newborn calf, for example, can walk almost immediately after being born. Why? Because all calves with genetic arrangements that didn\u2019t allow them to do so probably died out a long time ago. Herds would not have been able to readily defend their immobile young from predators. Calves do not need to be taught by their mothers how to stand, walk, or run. They know how to do this *automatically* at birth\u2013instinctively. As another example, geneticists say there was once a bottleneck in the human gene pool. This roughly coincided with a cataclysmic environmental event seen in the geologic record. This event seems to have resulted in humans being able to out-endure virtually every other animal on the planet, in terms of the ability to keep moving. We may not be the strongest or the fastest animal, but we don\u2019t have to outrun our prey if we can simply outlast our prey. Humans can comfortably follow an animal until it collapses from exhaustion, at which point we\u2019re able to kill it with ease for its meat. This is because all the ancient humans who couldn\u2019t keep moving after that disaster died off, just like the cattle without the genes to let them walk immediately after being born. Now, humans also have the benefit of intelligence\u2013we can track animals and learn their location without seeing or smelling them. That physical endurance, coupled with intellectual prowess\u2013and the knowledge that anyone who didn\u2019t have it would have died off\u2013defined the first settlement-based human cultures.\r\n\r\nNOW WE REACH THE CONCLUSION! Yay. Here\u2019s where we draw **the distinction between culture and morality**. Cultures differ, both between and within species\u00a0(races). Culture, like instinct, is in many ways simply a higher-order chemical response to external stimuli. Scandinavians have a culture of fishing, rather than the Mediterranean culture of farming, because of the environment of their homelands. It\u2019s colder, rockier, the soil is different, etc. Their houses differ (because of the environment), their festivals differ, their tools and weapons differ, their artwork differs, etc. The things they prize over others, culturally, differ (fuel for warmth vs. marble for carving, etc. I\u2019m being reductive). The *reason* they prize these things is the same. We call instinct \u201cgenetically coded behavior.\u201d The behaviors are autonomous in nature, as they\u2019re the result of the chemical processes (which are the result of the atomic processes, which are a function of the four fundamental forces) which developed to ensure the individual\u2019s survival. Where culture is \u201c**a** collection of higher order behaviors which have *happened* to ensure survival\u201d, morality is \u201c**the** collection of higher order behaviors which guarantee the **highest chance** of survival.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe see, across cultures\u2013across *contact* of cultures\u2013and across time, a unified, codified set of behaviors, held by all of them. The *expression* of those behaviors might appear different (the steps to complete them might be different in operation), but the nature of the *result* of the behavior is the same, because it\u2019s predicated on the biological (chemical, atomic, fundamental) processes which led to the codification of the moral tenets.", "body_html": "<p>I\u2019ll give you the short version.</p>\n<p>The Universe is built upon <strong>four fundamental forces</strong>. These forces operate identically no matter the scale (quantum to galactic), no matter the environment (open space, the center of a star, the core of a planet, the event horizon of a black hole, etc), and no matter the time (be it 0.1 second after the creation of the Universe or 10^100 years from now). These four fundamental forces are <em>utterly immutable</em>, <em>quantifiable</em>, and dictate how all higher order functions within the universe operate. They are objectively true. They are constants.</p>\n<p>From the restrictions put on matter by these forces come <strong>the first interactions of higher energy states</strong>\u2013quarks and electrons (we\u2019ll keep it simple and say those are it).

Using \"leftists\" in a nonobvious, dubious, and unclarified manner, and then assuming my definition of \"leftists\", is also unwelcome, and to claim that you can ascertain objective morality (infinitely beyond our subjective limits of knowledge as humans), and bashing leftists by insinuating that your use of the same tactic is justifiable or otherwise correct is frankly idiocy.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1598211896, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_8q9a", "guild": {"banner_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/censorship/banner-5.png", "color": "#603abb", "created_utc": 1582168207, "description": "Documenting and fighting censorship, anywhere, everywhere.\n\n[Click here to subscribe to our anti-censorship BitChute channel](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/PXMAWJOmBrWO/)\n\nFree Speech Content Hosting Options:\n\n* https://clouds.tf/\n\n* https://maga.host/\n\n* https://catbox.moe/\n\nArchive Tools: \n\n* https://archive.vn/\n* [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/)\n\nSave Twitter Videos:\n\n* https://www.savetweetvid.com/", "description_html": "<p>Documenting and fighting censorship, anywhere, everywhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/channel/PXMAWJOmBrWO/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe to our anti-censorship BitChute channel</a></p>\n<p>Free Speech Content Hosting Options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://clouds.tf/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://clouds.tf/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>https://maga.host/</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>https://catbox.moe/</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Archive Tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://archive.vn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.vn/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://archive.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Wayback Machine</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Save Twitter Videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.savetweetvid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.savetweetvid.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "disallowbots": false, "fullname": "t4_25", "id": "25", "is_banned": false, "is_private": false, "is_restricted": false, "is_siege_protected": false, "name": "Censorship", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/+Censorship", "profile_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/board/censorship/profile-2.png"}, "guild_id": "25", "herald_guild": null, "id": "8q9a", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 9, "parent": {"author_name": "_Account_9ad", "award_count": 0, "body": ">with some misconceptions or wrongs\r\n\r\nPlease elucidate.
