The more this goes on the more cliquey it will become, until eventually the admins won't even talk to anyone except those mods in private admin channels (like on reddit). I'm not really sure how the admins know the current mods, but already they seem to pay more attention to them than anyone else. That's fine of course if they're friends somehow, but it shouldn't get to the point of giving them access to admin stuff that's not available to anyone else or other kinds of special treatment.</p>\n", "created_utc": 1594232275, "downvotes": 0, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_2l2r", "guild_id": "1c", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2l2r", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 6, "parent_comment_id": ["2l00"], "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/xva/the-slippery-slope-of-moderation/2l2r", "post_id": "xva", "score": 1, "upvotes": 1, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["2l2r"], "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/xva/the-slippery-slope-of-moderation/2l46", "post": {"author_name": "your_neighbour", "award_count": 0, "body": "See link.\r\n\r\nEven as people are kicked out of reddit, they have not given up on applying the slippery slope of exporting the favor based moderation, won't name names but I recall seeing people calling for language censorship already on ruqqus discord.\r\n\r\n", "body_html": "<p>See link.</p>\n<p>Even as people are kicked out of reddit, they have not given up on applying the slippery slope of exporting the favor based moderation, won't name names but I recall seeing people calling for language censorship already on ruqqus discord.</p>\n", "comment_count": 12, "created_utc": 1594212229, "domain": "reddit.com", "downvotes": 2, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_xva", "guild_id": "1c", "guild_name": "WatchRedditDie", "herald_guild": null, "id": "xva", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+WatchRedditDie/post/xva/the-slippery-slope-of-moderation", "score": 15, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/xva/thumb.png", "title": "The slippery slope of \"moderation\"", "upvotes": 15, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Cabal/comments/fnvnrp/important_read_a_complete_comprehensive_summary/"}, "post_id": "xva", "score": 1, "upvotes": 2, "voted": 0}
