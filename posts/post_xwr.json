China claims it is protecting national security. But the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society. Beijing\u2019s decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China\u2019s invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-actions-china/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-actions-china/</a></p>\n", "created_utc": 1594223236, "downvotes": 1, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t3_2kdw", "guild_id": "19", "herald_guild": null, "id": "2kdw", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "level": 1, "permalink": "/+News/post/xwr/speaking-out-against-china-on-hong/2kdw", "post_id": "xwr", "score": 5, "upvotes": 5, "voted": null}, "parent_comment_id": ["2kdw"], "permalink": "/+News/post/xwr/speaking-out-against-china-on-hong/2knd", "post": {"author_name": "JaceLightning", "award_count": 0, "body": "", "body_html": "", "comment_count": 142, "created_utc": 1594214309, "domain": "axios.com", "downvotes": 4, "edited_utc": 0, "fullname": "t2_xwr", "guild_id": "19", "guild_name": "News", "herald_guild": null, "id": "xwr", "is_archived": true, "is_banned": false, "is_bot": false, "is_crosspost": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_distinguished": false, "is_heralded": false, "is_nsfl": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_offensive": false, "is_pinned": false, "meta_description": null, "meta_title": null, "original_guild_id": null, "original_guild_name": null, "permalink": "/+News/post/xwr/speaking-out-against-china-on-hong", "score": 212, "thumb_url": "https://i.ruqqus.com/posts/xwr/thumb.png", "title": "Speaking out against China on Hong Kong is now illegal worldwide", "upvotes": 213, "url": "https://www.axios.com/china-hong-kong-law-global-activism-ff1ea6d1-0589-4a71-a462-eda5bea3f78f.html"}, "post_id": "xwr", "score": 5, "upvotes": 9, "voted": 0}
