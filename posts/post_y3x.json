I haven't asked to be a mod before just now. I can't speak for the others, but Angstkitten only got modded because she was on Discord after the admins went to bed and people started spamming NSFW stuff in a SFW channel. i believe she messaged the admins and they modded her so she could take care of it. It was a \"right place at the right time\" thing and not a favoritism thing at all.</p>\n<p>I know before this massive influx of users, admins were thinking about implementing some kind of \"trusted user\" system so they admins didn't get overwhelmed dealing with reports once the site gets bigger, but with the way people are reacting to the discord mods, it may give people the impression that admins have favorites.</p>\n","created_utc":1594240425,"downvotes":1,"edited_utc":0,"fullname":"t3_2lya","guild":{"banner_url":"https://i.ruqqus.com/board/ruqqus/banner-2.png","color":"#805AD5","created_utc":1575480088,"description":"The official guild for all things Ruqqus.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nðŸ’» No promotion of other sites that aren't a fork of Ruqqus\r\n\r\nðŸŸª Ruqqus-related only.
