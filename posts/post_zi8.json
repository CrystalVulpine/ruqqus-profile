This ends up being that only friends of the admins are able to join, and most of everyone else isn't even aware that this network exists. There is no fair selection process so that any trustworthy Ruqqus user can become part of this group. This ends up being the same as the \"DefaultMods\" group on reddit, aka *the cabal*.\r\n\r\nNow, it's a lot different on Ruqqus. For starters, they're not colluding to censor things they don't like. They're not up to anything evil or trying to cover up their existence. And everyone that I know of who is currently part of this group *is* very fit for these tasks, unlike on reddit where they all just like having power. They're genuinely trying to help contribute to Ruqqus and answer questions. I don't blame them for this at all right now, as it's the admins who find new members.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that membership in this group is far too exclusive. If in the future they become more prideful of their positions, because it functions more like a clique, it could easily become a cabal like what we have on reddit and Digg. This is bound to happen eventually given the natural tendency of cliques to not like out-members, so having anything like that in charge of anything is not a good idea. This site champions free speech and doesn't like powermods, but the admins are still running it like a bureaucracy of arbitrarily selected members. One possible solution is that instead of the admins coming to you for membership in this group, users should ask the admins to be added.\r\n\r\nIf we want to learn from reddit and Digg, the approach to who gets into the trusted user/public service group has to change. Obviously you can't add people who are a day old and look like they're up to no good. But the doors should be open to anyone who is regularly helpful and acting in good faith.\r\n\r\nPlease, *please* don't give any members of this group a hard time about it. Chances are most of them aren't even aware of how it's run. Some of them are my friends. They are very helpful and kind people and are just performing their regular duties. Don't punish them for doing good deeds here. In fact, they are the ones who are most likely to convince the admins to fix this problem. This is an organizational change that they have no control over and has to come from the admins.","body_html":"<p>The admins mentioned that in the future they will implement a \"trusted user\" system in which certain users have access to admin tools and resources to help the staff.</p>\n<p>Some of this is already being implemented. Examples include moderating the Ruqqus Discord and official admin-sponsored guilds, and being part of a \"PSA (Public Service Announcement)\" group coordinated by the admins, where users make official announcements and contributions to Ruqqus, and can answer questions with authority.
