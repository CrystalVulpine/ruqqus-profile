(Edit: He posted about his post getting removed [here](https://archive.is/yEZ0v). Also, [there's someone called Realm\\_of\\_stars on SaidIt](https://saidit.net/s/Introductions/comments/72zg/why_im_here/), and I think it may be him.)\n\nCopy of the post in text form because I don't like screenshots (there may be errors because I used some free online OCR service):\n\n* * * * *\n\nSNEED\n\nthat's the thing that started this.\n\na simple comment to the dumb dyke no\\_chill, who told me to hang myself many times. i simply responded, with this: \"get raped and die\"\n\nhow is this a threat? i can say \"i will rape you\" and that shows intent, but wishing something bad on someone isn't a threat.\n\nputting that aside, i'd like to make a statement.\n\nthis account will be for throwaway purposes and will not be used for ban evasion, although i personally believe that the admins will ban me out of spite.\n\nI loved this site. i came on board a few months back, posting sporadically and building guilds, having fun, and posting the memes i found in /pol/ humour threads as well as some of my own making. i truly believed that this site would be a good place for freedom of speech and general debauchery.\n\noh how i was wrong.\n\nthis shithole was rigged from the start, by the admins, a group of soyboy cucks with no morality, and no backbone. it's pretty obvious that these guys are cucks by the fact that they use discord and have gaming events, lol. but alas, ad hominem aside, the real issue is their blatant double standards.\n\nthe banning of carp was just a 4d chess move to distract everyone while they banned me, darkforge, and some other dissidents. they didn't go after heavy hitters like milkit since that would stir up controversy, so they got the next best thing, two of thememery's top posters. i won't flatter myself but i became a popular user in a short amount of time and helped keep the guild from having stagnation and a lack of posts.\n\nanyway, the shills ruined it like they ruined reddit, just WAY faster and harder.\n\nhere's the thing: if you give these nigger faggots any ground, they will PUSH like a negress in labor. they spit out that negroid baby faster than you can tie your shoes, and the results are disastrous.\n\ni'm waxing poetic. i'm sad and will miss everyone here. there's a better alternative, called poal. here's my profile: [https://poal.co/u/realm\\_of\\_stars](https://poal.co/u/realm_of_stars)\n\ni hope to see you on the other side. i might answer questions but i expect to be banned within a few hours.\n\nSNEED\n\nFUCK NIGGERS\n\nFUCK JANNIES\n\nFUCK TRANNIES\n\nFUCK JEWS\n\nFUCK ADMINS\n\nSEIG HEIL!\n\n[email\u00a0protected]\\_of\\_stars\n\np.s: change da world, my final message. goodby e."}

Ruqqus is filtering out the n-word, and it doesn't show up in [![](https://ruqqus.com/+All/pic/profile)+All](https://ruqqus.com/+All). Probably will be fixed soon.\n\nI think it was fixed now, so this should show up in /all.\n\n* * * * *\n\n**Ruqqus is now quarantining guilds. Certain words in your post and you can\u2019t reach /all.**\n\nRuqqus will not let bad words reach their front page. Sound familiar?\n\nMade four posts to [![](https://ruqqus.com/+WhiteVictimsofBlackCrime/pic/profile)+WhiteVictimsofBlackCrime](https://ruqqus.com/+WhiteVictimsofBlackCrime). Two contained the word nigger, two did not. https://files.catbox.moe/a9m4ju.jpeg\n\nOnly two posts without the word nigger show up in all/new https://files.catbox.moe/vxtv95.jpeg\n\nOy Vey Goyim, your sub is quarantined.\n\nThe admins should be honest about the censorship. Also, accounts are being frozen at -5 rep. This is reddit 2.0 with shitty servers.\n\nEdit: funny how this post doesn\u2019t show up in /new either. I made a post after this that did, so it\u2019s not the account that quarantined. Admins don\u2019t want you to know.\n\n[https://archive.fo/a99xg](https://archive.fo/a99xg)"}
